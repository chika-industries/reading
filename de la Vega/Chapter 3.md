Here is a summary of the **Third Dialogue** of *Confusion de Confusiones*:

The Shareholder describes the stock exchange as a great comedy where speculators play various roles, employing tricks, deceit, and manipulation. He then addresses the Philosopher's recent bad experience, where he was tricked into buying shares at an inflated price. The Shareholder reassures him that Exchange customs allow a trader to void a transaction if the price differs by 10 percent from the market rate, especially for a novice.

The dialogue then covers the practical mechanics of exchange operations:

**The West India Company:**
The Shareholder explains that unlike the prosperous East India Company, the West India Company has struggled. Founded in 1621, it once prospered but later declined so sharply that shares fell to 3.5 percent of par value. It was reorganized in 1674 through a complex process requiring additional payments from shareholders, depositors, and lenders. Currently, its main business involves supplying slaves from Guinea to Curaçao for sale to the Spanish West Indies, and its shares trade at around 110 percent.

**Trading Locations and Methods:**
Business is conducted in two main places: the Dam square (from 10 a.m. to noon) and the Exchange building (from noon to 2 p.m.). Transactions are concluded through handshakes and hand-slaps, accompanied by shouting, insults, and pushing. The Shareholder vividly describes the obsessive nature of speculators, who think, talk, and even dream about shares.

**Settlement Methods:**
There are three ways transactions are settled:
1.  **Direct transfers:** The seller appears at the Company offices to transfer shares to the buyer or lender, with payment made through the Bank.
2.  **Monthly settlements:** Shares are taken up on the 20th and paid for on the 25th. However, "rescounters" (brokers who balance commitments) often simply pay or receive the differences rather than handling actual shares.
3.  **Time bargains:** Transactions for future months, using printed contract forms.

**The "Appeal to Frederick" Clarified:**
The Shareholder explains the legal nuances of this provision. It applies to time bargains unless the seller transfers shares to the buyer's time account within a fortnight. Both buyers and sellers can theoretically invoke it, though court decisions have been inconsistent. The rules surrounding option contracts and hypothecation remain legally uncertain.

**Types of Brokers:**
-   **Sworn brokers:** Appointed by municipal authorities, limited in number, and sworn not to trade on their own account.
-   **Free brokers:** More numerous, often former businessmen seeking refuge, who earn a living through activity and zeal despite lacking official status.

**Ducaton Shares:**
The Shareholder explains this form of speculation, introduced in 1683 for those with limited capital. These were fictitious shares worth one-tenth of real East India shares (a ducaton equals 3 guilders per point versus 30 guilders for real shares). A "General Cashier" recorded all contracts. On the first of each month at 1:30 p.m., two impartial men would set the price based on real shares—a ceremony called "raising the stick." The speculation became so widespread that both sexes and even children participated, betting as little as a stuiver per point. The Shareholder warns that this "cure" for reducing risk has actually made danger more widespread.
