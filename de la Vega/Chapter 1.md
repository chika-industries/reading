The first chapter (First Dialogue) of *Confusion de Confusiones* introduces the mysterious and paradoxical world of stock speculation through a conversation between a Philosopher, a Merchant, and a Shareholder.

The Shareholder describes stock trading as the "fairest and most deceitful" business in Europe. He explains that there are three classes of people involved:
1.  **The capitalists (or "princes of business")** who own shares for their dividends and don't speculate on price movements.
2.  **The merchants** who buy and sell shares based on news and trends, seeking secure, moderate profits.
3.  **The speculators (or gamblers)** who are the primary focus of the dialogue. They engage in risky trades, often buying shares ("a regiment") they cannot afford, hoping to profit from price fluctuations.

The Shareholder details the mechanics of speculation, including buying on credit, hypothecating shares (borrowing against them), and the crucial monthly settlement dates. He reveals a key practice: when a speculative purchase goes bad, a trader could "appeal to Frederick," a legal loophole allowing them to void a contract for future delivery if they didn't own the shares at the time of sale, thus escaping their debt.

Finally, the Shareholder introduces "opsies" (options) as a way to speculate with limited risk. By paying a premium for the right to buy or sell shares at a future date, a person can limit their potential loss to the cost of the premium while still having the chance for significant gain. This, he argues, makes speculation accessible even to those with limited capital and allows them to protect their reputation.
