Here is a summary of the **Fourth Dialogue** of *Confusion de Confusiones*:

The Shareholder begins by recapping the previous dialogues before diving into the most complex and cunning machinations of the Exchange—the operations of secretive syndicates or rings (called "Cabalas").

**The Bears' Stratagems:**

He describes how a ring of ten to twelve speculators (bears) can manipulate the market downward through a series of calculated tricks:

1.  **Time Sales Attack:** They sell large blocks of shares for future delivery, forcing a decline. As prices fall, other speculators join in, amplifying the effect.
2.  **The Deceptive Broker:** They use a trusted broker to secretly buy shares from a bull, then publicly sell the same shares, creating the illusion that even bulls are selling. This triggers panic and widespread selling.
3.  **The False Alarm:** They sell shares for cash to a wealthy capitalist known to hypothecate stocks. Before the transaction closes, they spread rumors that this capitalist has received bad news and is selling. When the sales actually occur, the rumor seems confirmed, causing a crash.
4.  **Money Hoarding:** They borrow all available money at the Exchange, pretending they intend to buy. This prevents bulls from finding funds to hypothecate their shares, forcing them to sell instead. Simultaneously, they execute large sales of their own.
5.  **Call Options Pressure:** They sell as many call options as possible, pressuring premium payers to sell when they exercise their rights.
6.  **Put Options Trap:** They enter into numerous put contracts, obligating the receivers (presumed bulls) to take stock, thus tying their hands and preventing them from buying.
7.  **The Hypothecation Noose:** They lend money to bulls by taking hypothecated shares, then turn around and sell those same shares. The bulls must then repurchase the shares they thought they had financed, trapping them in a cycle.
8.  **The Dropped Letter:** They arrange for a fabricated letter containing false news to be "accidentally" dropped. The finder, believing it a treasure, spreads the news, which triggers the desired market reaction.
9.  **The Innocent Front:** They persuade a respected person with no Exchange experience to sell shares (with the ring backing any losses). His unexpected entry into selling astonishes the market and has significant impact.
10. **The Whispered Secret:** They whisper "advice" to sell loudly enough for others to overhear. The secret spreads, others follow, and the ring's objective is achieved.
11. **Selling Government Bonds:** They sell state obligations to create the impression that political troubles or war threatens, undermining confidence in the Company.
12. **Test Purchases:** Before launching a major attack, they buy shares to test the market's direction. Even if they lose on these test purchases, they gain valuable intelligence, and the public interprets their willingness to take losses as a sign that conditions must truly be serious.

**The Bulls' Defenses and Broker Tricks:**

When asked if the bulls have any defenses, the Shareholder notes they use similar tactics, but he focuses instead on the practices of sly brokers:

-   A broker receiving a large order must carefully conceal his intentions, sometimes offering shares while simultaneously asking for offers, to execute the order without moving the price against himself.
-   Brokers frequent **coffee houses** where deals are also made. A cunning broker might enter, quote an inflated price, and pretend to record orders, creating the illusion of high demand and enticing others to buy.
-   Some bulls **pose as bears**, selling shares to trick the real bears into thinking they have switched sides, only to reverse the market.
-   Brokers use specific **verbal formulas** ("I give them," "I give them to anybody") that carry different levels of commitment and risk.
-   Some brokers run **dual operations**, acting as both broker and principal, changing their signatures to conceal their own trading.
-   They use **abbreviated words** to communicate secretly, leading to frequent misunderstandings.

**The Great Crash:**

The Merchant asks about the recent dramatic collapse in share prices. The Shareholder explains:

-   Initially, everything looked perfect: peace in Europe, abundant money, and news from the Cape of Good Hope indicated rich cargoes from India.
-   The only concerning detail was that one heavily laden ship had returned to Batavia due to a dangerous list, but this was dismissed as minor.
-   When the ships arrived, it was revealed that the value of the imported goods (the *Inkoop*) was only 34 tons of gold compared to 50 tons the previous year.
-   Because even the bears had speculated on a rise (fooled by the positive outlook), there were no significant short sellers to cushion the fall. When the disappointing news hit, everyone tried to sell at once.
-   Prices plummeted from around 580 to 365.
-   The bears then spread rumors of impending war to prevent any recovery.
-   Later, it emerged that the 34 tons of goods would actually sell for as much profit as the previous 50 tons due to higher prices, but by then the damage was done.
-   The **ducaton speculation** was hit even harder. Courts declared it a mere game or bet, so contracts were unenforceable. Many honorable men paid what they could, but many others paid nothing, and some even bragged about cheating their creditors.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the devastation, the Shareholder still advises speculating for a rise rather than a fall, noting that shares have already recovered by 100 points since war was actually declared. He mourns the end of the ducaton speculation, which had supported many people of modest means, calling this period the "Year of Confusion."

The Merchant and Philosopher conclude that while they may hold shares honestly, they will never become speculators. The Philosopher remarks that on the Exchange, "the non-existent is better than the existent"—it is better not to be a speculator at all.
