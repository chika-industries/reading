## Summary of the Foreword and Introduction

**The Foreword (by Arthur H. Cole):**

The foreword explains why this translation was undertaken. Joseph de la Vega's *Confusion de Confusiones* (1688) is the first book ever written describing the practices of any stock exchange. It reveals that sophisticated financial instruments—such as puts, calls, pools, and manipulations—were already highly developed in the 17th century. The Amsterdam exchange was the world's leading financial center at the time. The original book is extremely rare, with only about six copies known to exist, one of which is held by Harvard's Kress Library. Because the original is written in a flowery, rhetorical style with many philosophical digressions, the translators decided to present only the portions directly relevant to business and economic history—essentially, the passages describing stock exchange practices. Cole acknowledges the difficulty of translation, involving multiple languages (Spanish, Dutch, German) and the need to render 17th-century financial jargon into modern American terminology. He credits several scholars who assisted, particularly Dr. Fritz Redlich and Professor Hermann Kellenbenz.

**The Introduction (by Hermann Kellenbenz):**

The introduction provides extensive background on the author, his community, and the historical context of the Amsterdam stock exchange.

**I. The Author's Ethnic Background:**
Joseph de la Vega belonged to the **Sephardic Jewish community** of Amsterdam. These were Jews whose ancestors had lived in Spain and Portugal, many of whom had been forced to convert to Christianity (*"Christianos nuevos"*) but secretly retained their faith. After the Inquisition intensified, they fled to more tolerant cities like Hamburg and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, they faced restrictions—they could not join guilds or operate retail shops—but they could engage in wholesale trade, shipping, money lending, and brokerage. They became known as "Portuguese Jews" because they spoke Portuguese in their congregations, though they often wrote literary works in Spanish. Contemporary accounts suggest that Jews were heavily involved in stock speculation, with one 1701 source claiming they handled "17 parts in 20" of the trade in East India Company shares.

**II. The de la Vega Family:**
The author's father, Isaac Penso, was born in Spain in 1608 as a "new Christian." He was imprisoned by the Inquisition and vowed to return to Judaism if released. After gaining freedom, he emigrated to Antwerp, then Hamburg, and finally Amsterdam, where he became a well-to-do banker and a respected leader of the Jewish community. The author, Joseph, took his mother's surname (de la Vega) according to tradition. His full name was Joseph Penso de la Vega Passarinho.

**III. Joseph de la Vega's Life and Works:**
Joseph was born around 1650, probably in northern Europe rather than Spain. As a youth, he spent time in Leghorn, Italy, before settling in Amsterdam, though he frequently visited Hamburg. He showed early literary talent, composing a Hebrew drama at age 17 (*Asire ha Tikkwah* or *The Prisoner of Hope*) in 1667. Although his family initially directed him toward becoming a rabbi, he became a businessman. He managed to balance commerce with writing, producing marriage poems, novels, speeches, and philosophical treatises. He was active in literary academies founded by the Spanish Resident Manuel de Belmonte, serving as secretary of the *Academia de los Floridos*. Beyond *Confusion de Confusiones* (1688), his notable works include *Rumbos Peligrosos* (*Dangerous Travels*, a collection of novels), funeral orations for his parents, and panegyrics dedicated to various dignitaries. He died around 1692 and was buried in Oudekerk on the Amstel.

**IV. The Style and Purpose of the Book:**
De la Vega dedicated his dialogues to Duarte Nunes da Costa, a respected member of the Portuguese community. The dedication exemplifies the author's flowery, affected *"estilo culto"*—a complicated, pun-filled style he was proud of but which makes his work difficult for modern readers. He claimed three motives for writing:
1.  His own pleasure.
2.  To describe for non-participants a business that was "the most honest and most useful" of his time.
3.  To expose the tricks of rascals, both to warn potential victims and to unmask evildoers.

He chose the **dialogue form** because it allowed him to present different perspectives objectively while expressing his own views through the "Shareholder" character. This literary form had ancient precedents (Plato) and Renaissance revivals (Petrarch, Erasmus, Cervantes).

**V. Historical Context of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange:**
Trade and speculation in stocks began with the founding of the **Dutch East India Company** in 1602, when six local chambers were united into a single national company. Initially, shares were called "*paerten*" (participations); the term "*actie*" came into use around 1606. Amsterdam held more than half the shares, making it the center of trading.

- **Early Speculation:** Shares rose quickly, doubling by 1607. In 1608, a speculator named Isaac Le Maire organized a group to manipulate prices downward through short selling and spreading negative rumors.
- **Government Response:** On February 27, 1610, the first edict was issued prohibiting "*windhandel*" (trading in shares the seller did not possess). Future edicts followed in 1621, 1630, 1636, and 1677, but abuses continued.
- **The 1680s Boom:** Trading increased significantly in the 1680s, prompting public debate. In 1687, lawyer Nicolaas Muys van Holy published a pamphlet condemning speculation and proposing a tax on transactions. The Amsterdam magistrate issued a decree on January 13, 1689, levying such a tax.
- **De la Vega's Contribution:** His book appeared in 1688, at the height of this activity. It provides a realistic picture of the market, describing most of the speculative practices still used today: trading for the rise or decline, options, differences, prolongations, liquidations, and brokerage.

**VI. Technical Explanations of Exchange Operations:**
The introduction provides essential context for understanding the dialogues:

- **The Security:** The primary stock was the Dutch East India Company, with a nominal value of 500 pounds Flemish (3,000 guilders). In 1688, it traded at around 580 percent, meaning a single share was worth over 17,000 guilders—a very high unit value that encouraged alternative speculation methods.
- **Market Participants:** Wealthy investors (who lived on dividends), occasional speculators (mostly merchants), persistent speculators, the Bank of Amsterdam, money lenders, brokers, and "rescounters" (who settled differences).
- **Types of Transactions:**
    - Cash sales.
    - Purchases with borrowed money (hypothecation, up to four-fifths of value).
    - Future contracts (specified settlement dates beyond monthly settlements).
    - Option contracts (calls and puts, with premiums paid).
    - **Ducaton shares:** Fictitious shares worth one-tenth of real shares, used for gambling on price differences with monthly settlements. These were popular from 1683 until the crash just before de la Vega finished writing.
- **Settlement:** Real stock settled on the 20th of each month, with payment due on the 25th. Ducaton shares settled at month's beginning (and possibly mid-month). Payments were often made through the Bank of Amsterdam.
- **Transfer of Shares:** Shares were not negotiable paper; transfer required both parties to appear at the Company offices and have the transaction recorded by the secretary.
- **Brokers:** Two types—**sworn brokers** (licensed, limited in number, forbidden to trade on their own account) and **free brokers** (unlicensed, more numerous, sometimes traded on their own account). Brokers often aligned with either the bull or bear factions.
- **Legal Restraints:** The main restraint was the prohibition on short selling, with edicts allowing an "*appeal to Frederick*"—the right to repudiate certain types of contracts. However, enforcement was weak, court decisions were inconsistent, and many transactions occurred in a legal gray area.

**VII. The Book's Significance:**
*Confusion de Confusiones* had little immediate impact, as it was written in Spanish (not Dutch) and in an overly literary style. No Dutch translation appeared until 1939. However, for modern scholars, it is an invaluable source on 17th-century financial practices, demonstrating how rapidly stock trading became sophisticated and how many modern techniques were already in use.
