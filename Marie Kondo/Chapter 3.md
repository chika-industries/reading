### Chapter 3: Tidying by category works like magic

This is the longest and most practical chapter in the book, serving as a step-by-step manual for the discarding phase. Kondo walks the reader through each category in the specific order she prescribes, offering detailed advice on how to apply the "spark joy" test and what common pitfalls to avoid.

**The Correct Order of Categories (Reinforced):**
Kondo reiterates the inviolable order: **Clothes → Books → Papers → Komono (Miscellany) → Mementos.**

---

**1. Clothing**
- **The Process:** Gather *every* piece of clothing in the house and pile it on the floor. It is always more than you expect.
- **Start with Off-Season Clothes:** It's easier to be objective about clothes you don't currently need. Ask, "Do I want to see this again next season?"
- **The "Loungewear" Trap:** Never downgrade clothes you don't like to "loungewear." You won't wear them, and you deserve to wear clothes you love even at home.
- **The Art of Folding:** Kondo strongly advocates folding over hanging to save space and connect with your clothes.
    - Folding is a form of communication and healing, transmitting energy to the fabric.
    - The goal is to fold each garment into a smooth, compact rectangle so it can stand upright.
    - Clothes should be stored **vertically** in drawers, like files, so you can see every item at a glance.
- **Hanging Clothes:** Hang clothes that are happier hanging (e.g., dresses, jackets). Organize them in a closet so they "rise to the right"—with heavy, dark, long items on the left and light, short items on the right. This creates a sense of energy and ease.
- **Storing Socks:** Kondo delivers a passionate plea to never, ever ball up your socks. This stretches them out and denies them their rightful rest. She provides instructions for folding and standing socks upright in a box (like a shoebox) so they can relax.
- **No More Seasonal Storage:** With modern climate control, there's no need to pack away off-season clothes. Keep everything accessible year-round to always know what you own.

**2. Books**
- **The Process:** Just like clothes, take *every* book off the shelves and put them on the floor. Do not try to choose them while they are on the shelf.
- **The Criterion:** The standard is the same: keep only those that spark joy. Do not start reading them, as this will cloud your judgment.
- **Unread Books:** The phrase "someday I'll read it" is a lie. If you haven't read it by now, its purpose was to teach you that you don't need it. Let it go.
- **Books to Keep:** Keep only those that truly belong in your "hall of fame." Kondo shares a story of trying to salvage quotes from books before discarding them, only to realize she never looked at them again. This reinforces the idea that the physical book is often unnecessary once its information has been received.

**3. Papers**
- **Rule of Thumb: Discard everything.** Kondo states that papers will never spark joy. The only exceptions are papers that are: **currently in use, needed for a limited time, or must be kept indefinitely.**
- **Simplified Filing:** Her filing system is brutally simple. Only three categories:
    1.  **Needs Attention** (e.g., a letter to reply to). Keep these in one standing holder and deal with them.
    2.  **Must Keep (Contractual)** (e.g., insurance policies, warranties). Store these in one simple folder without subdividing.
    3.  **Must Keep (Other)** (e.g., receipts for tax purposes). Store these separately.
- **Troublesome Papers:** She offers specific advice on common paper clutter:
    - **Seminar Materials:** Discard them. If you haven't applied the learning, the material is useless.
    - **Credit Card Statements:** Discard after checking and recording.
    - **Product Manuals:** Discard them. You can find solutions online.
    - **Warranties:** Keep them all in one simple file, not separated. This forces you to look through them when you need one, allowing you to naturally check expiry dates.

**4. Komono (Miscellany)**
- This is the most diverse category, containing everything from CDs and cosmetics to kitchen supplies and electronics.
- **The Danger:** These items accumulate "just because." They must be handled one by one.
- **Subcategories:** Kondo provides a suggested order for tackling komono, starting with more personal items (CDs, skincare) and moving to household items (kitchen goods, supplies).
- **Common Types to Discard:** She lists many items that are almost always disposable, including:
    - Gifts you don't love (thank them for the sentiment and let them go).
    - Unused cosmetic samples.
    - Boxes for electronics and appliances.
    - Mystery cords and broken appliances.
    - Spare buttons (you will never use them).
    - Free novelty goods.
- **Small Change:** A surprising amount of clutter is loose change. Her motto is **"into my wallet!"** Never put coins in a piggybank to be forgotten; use them.

**5. Mementos (Sentimental Items)**
- **Saved for Last:** Kondo strongly reiterates that this category must be tackled only after you have honed your decision-making skills on all other categories.
- **Your Parents' Home is Not a Haven:** Sending sentimental items to your parents' house is just transferring the problem. You are not truly confronting your past.
- **Photos:** These should be dealt with last. You must remove them from albums and look at them one by one. You will naturally keep only a select few that truly spark joy, and those will be enough to evoke the full memory.

**Concluding the Chapter:**
- **Astounding Stockpiles:** Kondo shares humorous anecdotes of clients with enormous stockpiles (e.g., 60 toothbrushes), proving that we often hoard out of a misplaced sense of anxiety.
- **The "Click Point":** As you discard, you will eventually reach a moment where you intuitively know the exact volume of possessions is right for you. This feeling of "just enough" is the key to never rebounding.
- **Follow Your Intuition:** Kondo concludes by reinforcing that the entire process is about listening to your own inner voice. Tidying by your own standards, not someone else's numerical rules, is the only way to create lasting change. The goal is not just a tidy room, but a vibrant and happy life.
