### Introduction (Pages 9-14)

The book opens with a powerful introduction where Kondo lays out the fundamental promise of her method: if you tidy completely and in one go, you will never revert to clutter again. She introduces herself and her background, explaining that her obsession with tidying began in childhood and led to the creation of the **KonMari Method**.

Kondo dispels the common myth that tidying leads to a "rebound effect," stating that rebounds happen only because people haven't tidied properly or completely. She emphasizes that her approach is not just a set of techniques but a guide to acquiring the right **mindset**. True, lasting order comes not from clever storage solutions, but from a person's awareness and their decision to live only with things they value. She shares testimonials from clients whose lives were transformed after tidying, not just their homes, and sets the stage for the book by promising that the act of tidying, when done correctly, can reset your entire life.

### Chapter 1: Why can't I keep my house in order?

This chapter diagnoses the common reasons why people fail to stay organized and introduces the core philosophy of the KonMari Method. Kondo dismantles conventional tidying wisdom and replaces it with her own proven principles.

Key points from the chapter include:

- **Tidying is a skill, not an innate ability:** No one is born messy. The reason people can't keep their houses in order is simply because they were never properly taught how. It's a skill that can and must be learned.
- **Tidy completely in one go to prevent rebound:** The common advice to "tidy a little each day" is a trap. It ensures you'll be tidying forever. Instead, a sudden, drastic, and complete tidying event creates a transformative shift in mindset that makes rebounding impossible.
- **Aim for perfection:** Don't be afraid of this goal. Tidying is a physical act with a clear finish line. By making a one-time effort to achieve perfection, you will finally experience what a truly ordered space feels like.
- **Tidying resets your life:** Kondo explains that a messy room is often a symptom of a deeper issue. When you finally clear the physical clutter, you are forced to confront the psychological clutter you've been avoiding, leading to a necessary and positive reset in your life.
- **Storage experts are hoarders:** Kondo admits she used to be one. Relying on clever storage products is a trap; it just hides the problem. You end up with a house full of storage items but no real order. **Tidying must begin with discarding, not storing.**
- **Sort by category, not by location:** This is a cornerstone of the method. Tidying one room at a time is a mistake because similar items are stored all over the house. To truly grasp how much you own, you must gather every item from a single category (e.g., all clothes) in one place before deciding what to keep.
- **Make tidying a special event, not a daily chore:** Kondo distinguishes between "daily tidying" (putting things back) and the "special event" of putting your entire house in order. This special event should be completed once and for all. After that, daily life is simply about enjoying your space and returning things to their designated homes.
