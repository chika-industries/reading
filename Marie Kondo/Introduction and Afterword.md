### Introduction (Pages 9-14)

The book opens with a powerful promise: if you tidy completely and in one go, using the KonMari Method, you will never revert to clutter again. Kondo introduces herself, explaining that her obsession with tidying began at age five and led to the creation of her unique approach. She dispels the myth of "rebound," arguing it only happens when people tidy halfway. The Introduction establishes that tidying is not just a set of techniques but a guide to acquiring the right **mindset**. She shares testimonials from clients whose lives transformed after tidying—they found new careers, improved relationships, and gained confidence—setting the stage for the book's central theme: tidying can reset your entire life.

### Afterword (Pages 114-115)

In this brief, personal afterword, Kondo shares a humorous and humble anecdote. She reveals that she once woke up with her neck and shoulders frozen stiff and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The diagnosis? She had "tidied too much" while helping a client, making her what she believes is the only person to have that written on a medical record.

Despite this, she confesses that even while recovering in bed, 90% of her thoughts were still about tidying. She expresses her deep motivation for writing the book: to share the "magic" she feels—the deep emotions of sending off items that have fulfilled their purpose, the thrill of finding the perfect place for something, and the fresh, pure air of a room that has been truly put in order. She concludes by thanking her publisher, her family, her possessions, and her home, and expresses her hope that more people will experience the joy of living surrounded only by the things they love.
