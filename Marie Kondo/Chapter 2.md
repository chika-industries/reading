### Chapter 2: Finish discarding first

This chapter is the core operational guide for the first and most crucial phase of the KonMari Method: discarding. Kondo provides the philosophical and practical rules for this process, emphasizing that it must be completed in its entirety before any organizing or storing begins.

Key points from the chapter include:

- **Start by discarding, all at once, intensely, and completely:** To achieve a transformative change in mindset, the discarding process must be sudden and complete. It should be done in one shot, as quickly as possible, to create a profound shift in perspective that prevents rebound.
- **Tidy in the right order:** There are only two tasks: **discarding** and **deciding where to store things**. You must finish the first task completely before even thinking about the second.
- **Before you start, visualize your destination:** Don't just think "I want to be tidy." You must create a vivid, concrete image of the lifestyle you dream of. Kondo advises asking yourself "why?" repeatedly until you realize the ultimate goal is simply to be happy. This clarity provides the motivation to complete the process.
- **The ultimate selection criterion: Does it spark joy?** This is the most important rule in the book. The only true yardstick for deciding what to keep is to hold each item in your hand and ask yourself if it sparks joy. If it does, keep it. If not, thank it for its service and let it go. This shifts the focus from what to discard to what you *want* to keep.
- **Tidy by category, not by location:** Kondo reinforces this point from the previous chapter as the only efficient way to discard. Gather *every* item from a single category (e.g., all clothes from every room and closet) and lay them out in one spot before making any decisions.
- **The correct order of categories is crucial:** Start with the easiest items to build your decision-making "muscle." The sequence is:
    1.  **Clothes**
    2.  **Books**
    3.  **Papers**
    4.  **Komono (Miscellany)**
    5.  **Mementos (Sentimental items)**
- **Starting with mementos spells certain failure:** Sentimental items are the most difficult to discard. Tackling them first will overwhelm you and stop the entire process in its tracks. They must be left for last.
- **Don't let your family see your discards:** When you discard, do it discreetly. Family members, especially parents, may retrieve items out of sentiment or a sense of waste, simply transferring the clutter problem to their own space.
- **If you're mad at your family, check your own space:** Frustration with a messy family is often a sign that you are neglecting your own clutter. Tidying your own space quietly and completely will create a chain reaction, inspiring your family to do the same.
- **What you don't need, your family doesn't either:** Avoid the trap of "gifting" your unwanted items to family members just to assuage your own guilt. This just burdens them with things they don't truly want.
- **Tidying is a dialogue with one's self:** The process of selecting items based on joy is a form of introspection. Kondo recommends creating a quiet space for this work, ideally in the early morning when your mind is clearest.
- **What to do when you can't throw something away:** When you struggle to part with an item, examine its true purpose. Did it teach you what you don't like? Did it bring you joy at the moment of purchase? If so, its role in your life may already be complete. Thank it for that purpose and let it go. This reframes discarding as an act of gratitude, not waste.

In summary, Chapter 2 establishes the foundational rule of the KonMari Method: **you must finish discarding first**. It provides the key criterion for this process ("does it spark joy?"), the correct order for tackling categories, and the mental framework needed to part with things without guilt.
