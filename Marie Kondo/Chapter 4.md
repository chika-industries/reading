### Chapter 4: Storing your things to make your life shine

With the arduous process of discarding complete, this chapter focuses on the second and final task of the KonMari Method: storing the items you have chosen to keep. Kondo emphasizes that storage is not about clever gadgets or complex systems, but about simplicity, intentionality, and respect for your belongings.

Key points from the chapter include:

- **Designate a place for every thing:** This is the single most important rule of storage. Every possession you own must have a permanent, designated home. If an item lacks a place, it is destined to become clutter again. Kondo illustrates this by describing her own five-minute post-work routine, where every item from her handbag is returned to its specific spot.
- **Discard first, store later:** Kondo reiterates that you cannot effectively store until you have dramatically reduced your possessions. Once you have finished discarding, you will find that you have exactly the right amount of space, and storage becomes simple.
- **Pursue ultimate simplicity:** Forget complicated, ingenious storage solutions. They are often impractical. The goal is to be able to see at a glance how much you own. Complex storage only hides things and allows them to be forgotten.
- **Don't scatter storage spaces:** Store all items of the same type in the same place. If you live with family, designate one central storage spot per person. Concentrating belongings prevents them from spreading throughout the house and becoming invisible.
- **Forget "flow planning" and "frequency of use":** Do not store things based on where you use them. This leads to scattered storage. Instead, store things based on where they *belong*. Focus on making it easy to *put away*, not easy to *take out*. Clutter is caused by failing to return things, so the system must prioritize that action.
- **Never pile things; vertical storage is the key:** Stacking buries items and wears out the ones at the bottom. The KonMari rule is to store everything vertically. Fold clothes and stand them on end. Stand papers, files, and even small miscellany on edge. This makes the volume of your possessions immediately visible and keeps items from being crushed or forgotten.
- **No need for commercial storage items:** You do not need to buy expensive dividers or organizers. The best storage tools are already in your home. Kondo's top recommendation is the humble **shoebox**. It is the perfect size, durable, and versatile for organizing drawers (for socks, stockings, kitchen items, etc.) and cupboards.
- **Store bags inside bags:** To save space and maintain shape, store handbags inside one another like nesting boxes, leaving the straps visible so you don't forget what's inside.
- **Empty your bag every day:** Your handbag works hard for you and deserves to rest. Empty it daily and store its contents (wallet, train pass, etc.) in a designated box or spot. This prevents the accumulation of receipts and trash and ensures you don't forget what's inside.
- **Keep things out of the bath and kitchen sink:** High-moisture areas like the bath and kitchen sink are the worst places to store things. Bottles become slimy, and sponges never dry. Store these items in cupboards or dry areas. For the kitchen, Kondo even recommends removing the dish rack and drying dishes outside or in a colander on the veranda.
- **Make the top shelf your personal shrine:** Decorate the top shelf of a bookcase or closet with items that are sacred to you, like protective talismans or charms, treating it as a personal power spot.
- **Decorate your closet with your secret delights:** Your storage space is your private paradise. If you have posters, fan memorabilia, or other items you don't want to display publicly, use them to decorate the inside of your closet. This personalizes your space and brings you joy.
- **Unpack and de-tag new clothes immediately:** Leaving items in their packaging or with price tags on keeps them in a state of being "store products" rather than "personal possessions." Removing tags and packaging is a ritual that welcomes them into your home.
- **Don't underestimate the "noise" of written information:** Even in a tidy closet, labels on storage boxes (e.g., "Iyo Oranges," "Freshens Air Instantly!") create visual noise that clutters your mind. Remove product seals and labels from containers to create a more peaceful and serene environment.
- **Appreciate your possessions and gain strong allies:** Kondo urges readers to treat their belongings with gratitude. Thank your clothes for protecting you, your bag for its hard work. By treating your possessions well and giving them a proper place to rest, they become vibrant, dependable "supporters" in your life and will serve you better for longer.

In essence, this chapter transforms storage from a mundane chore into a sacred act. By simplifying, designating homes, and treating belongings with respect, you create a peaceful, harmonious environment where both you and your possessions can thrive. This sets the stage for the life-changing transformations discussed in the final chapter.
