This paper provides the first rigorous empirical analysis of Warren Buffett's investment performance at Berkshire Hathaway from 1976 to 2006, examining whether his exceptional returns can be explained by luck, risk, or investment skill.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Investment Style**: Contrary to Buffett's popular "value investor" image, the paper finds Berkshire primarily invests in **large-cap growth stocks** (77% large-cap, 41% growth), not traditional value stocks. This is important because the well-documented "value premium" cannot explain his performance.

2. **Exceptional Performance**: Berkshire's equity portfolio beat the S&P 500 in 27 of 31 years, with average annual excess returns of:
   - 11.14% over the S&P 500
   - 10.92% over the value-weighted market index
   - 8.56% over a Fama-French characteristic-based portfolio

3. **Concentrated Portfolio**: The top five holdings average 73% of portfolio value, creating significant unsystematic risk. However, this volatility stems from **large positive returns rather than downside risk** (upside/downside ratio of 18.8 vs. 3.9 for S&P 500).

4. **Skill vs. Luck**: Using Monte Carlo simulations to control for ex-post selection bias, the authors find the magnitude and frequency of Berkshire's outperformance make a "luck" explanation extremely unlikely, even accounting for manager-specific risk levels of 5-15%.

5. **Market Under-reaction**: A hypothetical portfolio mimicking Berkshire's public disclosures (with a one-month lag) still earned significant abnormal returns (10.75% annually), suggesting the market does not fully and immediately incorporate Buffett's information advantage.

6. **Event Study**: Initial public disclosure of Berkshire investments generates a 4.03% average abnormal return, with stronger reactions in the later period (4.40% vs. 0.82% in first half), indicating growing market recognition of Buffett's skill.

**Conclusion**: The evidence suggests Buffett, along with Charles Munger and Lou Simpson, possess genuine investment skill inconsistent with traditional interpretations of Efficient Market Theory. While Grossman-Stiglitz allows skilled investors to earn returns for information production, the slow price incorporation (evidenced by mimicking portfolio success) challenges EMT predictions about rapid information dissemination.
