Here is the summary of Chapter 9 of "Tax-Free Wealth."

### Summary of Chapter 9: Take Advantage of Your Tax Brackets

This chapter explains how to reduce your overall tax burden by spreading income among multiple people or entities that are in lower tax brackets than you are. The core idea is that tax brackets are progressive, so the more income you can keep in the lowest brackets, the less tax you pay.

- **Family as a Tax Shelter:** The author introduces the concept that family members, particularly children, can be one of the best tax shelters available. Because children have their own, much lower tax brackets, shifting income to them can result in significant family-wide tax savings.
- **The George Example:** A client named George wanted to pay no more than 15-20% tax. Instead of using a risky offshore strategy, he simply gave portions of his business to his six children. By spreading the business income across multiple family members, each with their own low tax brackets, the family saved over $44,000 in taxes in a single year compared to if George owned 100% of the business himself.
- **RULE #7: It's not how much you own that matters, it's how much you control.** George maintained complete control over the business and its cash flow by using an LLC (where he was the manager) and trusts (where he and his wife were trustees), even though his children owned most of the economic interest. You can give away ownership without giving away control.
- **Corporate Tax Brackets:** Just like individuals, corporations also have their own tax brackets, which start low and increase with income. You can take advantage of this by splitting a single business into multiple corporations.
- **The Franchise Model:** The author gives an example of a fast-food franchise owner who placed each individual restaurant in its own corporation. This allowed the first $50,000 of profit from *each* restaurant to be taxed at the lowest 15% corporate rate, resulting in millions of dollars in tax savings.
- **RULE #8: Treat your business just as you would if it were a big public company.** Big companies outsource. You can do the same by creating separate corporations for different functions like marketing, bookkeeping, or human resources. This provides a legitimate business purpose for having multiple entities.
- **RULE #9: All tax planning must have a business purpose other than reducing taxes.** The strategy must make business sense. Using a separate corporation for human resources (a Professional Employment Organization or PEO) is a great example—it simplifies payroll and reporting across multiple companies while also providing tax benefits.
- **The Sanjay Example:** A dentist (in the S quadrant) earning $400,000 used this strategy. He kept his dental practice in one entity but created two additional C corporations owned by him and his wife to provide marketing and administrative services to the practice. By shifting $50,000 of income to each of these corporations (where it was taxed at the low 15% corporate rate), he reduced his personal taxable income and saved $18,000 per year.
- **Don't Waste Your Own Low Brackets:** The chapter ends with a warning to ensure you don't waste your own low tax brackets. In a down-income year, you may need to intentionally create income to soak up your low brackets and avoid losing deductions that can't be carried forward.
- **Key Strategy #9:** The tax strategy is to **make your parents your business partners**. By giving a portion of your business (via LLC, S Corp, or partnership) to your elderly parents who are in a low tax bracket, the income from that share flows through to their return and is taxed at their low rates. You maintain control as the manager, and there are additional potential benefits like a "step-up" in basis for your parents' shares when they pass away.
