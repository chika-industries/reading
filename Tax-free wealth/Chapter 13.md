### Summary of Chapter 13: Estate Planning is Good Tax Planning

This chapter explains that estate planning isn't just about death—it's about maintaining control of your assets during your life and ensuring they go to the people and causes you choose, rather than to the government, after you die.

- **Two Goals of Estate Planning:** The author simplifies estate planning into two objectives: (1) making the financial aspects of your death as easy and painless as possible for your family, and (2) ensuring most (or all) of your assets go to your chosen heirs and charities, not to the government via estate taxes.
- **Avoiding Probate:** Probate is the court-supervised process of transferring assets after death. It's expensive, public, and time-consuming. The simple solution is to **title all major assets in a trust**. You can be the trustee of your own trust during your life, maintaining full control. Upon your death, the trust dictates where assets go, completely bypassing probate and keeping your affairs private.
- **The Importance of a Will:** A trust doesn't replace a will. A will is essential for appointing guardians for minor children and can address any assets accidentally left out of the trust. Together, a trust and a will cover most bases.
- **Estate Tax Rule #1: The lower your assets' value, the lower your estate tax.** The key is to get assets out of your estate (your name) during your lifetime while retaining control. Giving assets away outright triggers gift taxes, so more sophisticated methods are needed.
- **Estate Tax Rule #2: There is a portion of your assets that is not taxable (an exemption).** Every country with an estate tax has an exemption amount. The goal is to use strategies that keep your taxable estate within this exemption.
- **The Limited Partnership Solution:** A limited partnership is a powerful tool. You can be the **general partner** (owning as little as 1%) and maintain complete control over the assets. Your children or heirs can be **limited partners** (owning 99%), receiving the economic benefits but having no control. This moves value out of your estate while you keep control.
- **The Magic of Discounts:** When you give away a minority, non-controlling interest in a business or real estate to family members, its value is significantly less than a pro-rata share of the whole. This is due to two discounts:
    1.  **Minority Discount:** A 20% stake with no control is worth less than 20% of the total value.
    2.  **Marketability Discount:** A private company interest is hard to sell, further reducing its value.
    These discounts allow you to give away more ownership while using up less of your lifetime gift/estate tax exemption.
- **The George Example Revisited:** George, who gave 85% of his business to his children for income tax reasons, also reaped an estate tax benefit. Because he no longer owned those shares, only the 15% he retained was subject to estate tax at his death.
- **Key Strategy #13:** The tax strategy is to use **charitable trusts** to reduce both income and estate taxes.
    - **Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):** You put assets in the trust. You receive income from the assets for life. Upon your death, the assets go to your chosen charity. You get an income tax deduction now and an estate tax deduction later.
    - **Charitable Lead Trust (CLT):** The charity receives the income from the trust for a set number of years. Upon your death (or after the term), the assets go to your family. This can also provide estate tax benefits. These are powerful tools that require professional setup.
