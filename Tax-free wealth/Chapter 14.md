### Summary of Chapter 14: Reducing Your Taxes in Other Locations

This chapter addresses the complexities and opportunities that arise when you do business or own investments in multiple states, provinces, or countries. The key insight is that being taxed in multiple locations can actually lower your overall tax bill if you understand the rules.

- **The Risk of Ignoring Geography:** Many business owners don't realize they may be required to pay taxes in every location where they have a connection. If you wait for tax collectors to find you, you'll face back taxes, penalties, and interest. A little planning upfront can prevent this and even reduce your taxes.
- **Basic Nexus Principles:** You will generally be taxed in locations where you have:
    - Property
    - An office
    - Employees
    - (Sometimes) independent contractors or a significant customer base
- **RULE #11: Every location has different tax rules, and paying tax in several locations can result in paying less total tax than you would if you did business in only one location.**
- **The Apportionment Formula:** States and provinces use formulas to determine how much of your income is taxable within their borders. These formulas typically include factors like property, payroll, and *sales*. By understanding these formulas, you can structure your operations so that some of your income becomes "nowhere income"—not subject to tax in any jurisdiction.
- **The "Nowhere Income" Opportunity:** The author explains that if you are only taxed in one state, 100% of your income is taxed there. However, if you are taxed in multiple states, you may only pay tax on a portion of your income. For example, if you have employees in State A and a warehouse in State B (which has no income tax), sales shipped to State C might escape taxation entirely, reducing your overall state tax burden by 40-50%.
- **Avoiding Double Taxation with Foreign Tax Credit:** When doing business in another country, you risk being taxed twice on the same income. The solution is the **foreign tax credit**. Most countries allow a credit for taxes paid to a foreign country on income earned there.
- **RULE #12: To receive the foreign tax credit, the same taxpayer (entity) who pays the tax in the foreign country has to report the income in the home country.**
- **Entity Mismatch Warning:** A critical caution is provided about using the wrong entity type in different countries. For example, a U.S. LLC is treated as a "disregarded entity" (taxed to the owner) in the U.S., but Canada treats an LLC as a corporation. If a U.S. person uses an LLC to do business in Canada, the *corporation* pays Canadian tax, but the *individual* pays U.S. tax on the same income. The foreign tax credit is lost because the taxpayers are different, resulting in double taxation.
- **Offshore Planning:** For businesses that can operate remotely, consider basing operations in a country with low or no taxes (like some Caribbean nations). Alternatively, within a country like the U.S., choose to operate in states with no income tax (Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Florida) or low corporate rates (like Alberta in Canada).
- **Key Strategy #14:** The tax strategy is to **ensure you are taxed in more than one state**. Many business owners try to avoid multi-state taxation, but the smarter move is to embrace it. By having a business presence (like a warehouse) in at least two states, you trigger the apportionment formulas. This allows you to exclude sales shipped to other states from taxation, potentially reducing your state tax liability on a significant portion of your income.
