### Summary of Chapter 11: Conquer Your Employment Tax Troll

This chapter addresses payroll taxes—often called Social Security, Medicare, or National Insurance contributions—which the author describes as particularly frustrating because they offer little control or return on your money. The focus is on how business owners can legally reduce these taxes.

- **The Problem with Employment Taxes:** The author shares his personal disdain for being forced to pay into government programs like Social Security and Medicare, which he believes he'll never benefit from. These taxes are significant—sometimes higher than income tax—and employees have no control over them.
- **The Left Side vs. Right Side:** Employees (E) and most self-employed individuals (S) have little to no ability to reduce their employment taxes. However, if you earn income from the right side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant (B and I), particularly through business ownership, you can structure your affairs to minimize or avoid these taxes entirely.
- **RULE #10: When you want to reduce a tax, reduce the base on which it's measured.** Employment taxes are typically calculated on "wages" or "self-employment income." The key is to reduce the amount of income that falls into that tax base.
- **The S Corporation Solution:** In the United States, the primary strategy is to operate your business as an S corporation. As an owner-employee of an S corp, you are required to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" for the work you do. This salary is subject to employment taxes. However, any remaining profits from the business are paid to you as distributions, which are **not** subject to employment taxes.
- **The Chiropractor Example:** The author walks through the example of Michael, a self-employed chiropractor who paid maximum self-employment tax on all his income. By setting up an S corporation, Michael became both an employee and an owner. He now pays himself a reasonable salary (subject to employment taxes) and takes the rest of the profits as distributions (free from employment taxes).
- **The "Reasonable Salary" Caveat:** The government is aware of this strategy and requires that the salary be "reasonable" for the services performed. You cannot pay yourself a $10,000 salary and take $200,000 in distributions. A reasonable salary is what you would have to pay someone else to do your job. Websites like salary.com can help determine this. Paying too low a salary can trigger an audit, where the government may reclassify all your distributions as wages, leading to massive back taxes and penalties.
- **Choose Your Entity Wisely:** The strategy works best with an S corporation in the U.S. In other countries, the optimal entity might be a limited partnership or a small business corporation. The goal is the same: separate active income (subject to employment tax) from passive investment returns (not subject to it).
- **Key Strategy #11:** The tax strategy is to **reduce the wages you take from your business**. Determine the lowest "reasonable" salary you can justify for the work you perform. Remember that "salary" includes all forms of compensation, such as health insurance premiums paid by the company. Pay yourself this amount consistently (at least monthly) to avoid IRS scrutiny. This allows the maximum amount of business profit to flow to you as tax-advantaged distributions rather than taxable wages.
