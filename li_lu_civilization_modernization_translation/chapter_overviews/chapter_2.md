Here is a summary of the second chapter, **"The Trajectory of Civilization"** :

This chapter introduces the primary analytical tool Li Lu uses to study long-term history: the **Social Development Index** created by historian Ian Morris. The purpose of this index is to provide a quantitative, objective way to measure and compare the progress of different civilizations over very long periods.

The index measures a society’s ability to "get things done" by scoring it in four key categories:

1.  **Energy Capture:** The amount of energy (food, fuel, raw materials) each person can acquire per day. This is considered the most fundamental measure.
2.  **Social Organization:** The size of the largest permanent settlement (usually the largest city). Larger populations require more complex organization.
3.  **Information Technology:** The capacity to store and communicate information, from writing to the internet.
4.  **Capacity to Wage War:** The ability to mobilize force and equipment for conflict, a significant driver of energy use.

To make the data comparable across millennia, Morris created an index where the highest-scoring region in the **year 2000 AD** is set at a score of **1000**. The four categories are weighted equally at 250 points each.

Li Lu explains how Morris applies this index to two primary civilizational streams:
- **The West:** Starting with the earliest civilizations in the Middle East (the Hilly Flanks of the Tigris and Euphrates) and moving through Greece, Rome, and Europe to the modern United States.
- **The East:** Starting in the Yellow River Valley in China and spreading to the Yangtze River region, and eventually to other parts of East Asia like Japan.

The chapter then presents the key findings from the resulting charts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the book).

- **For most of history (from 14,000 BC to around 1800 AD), the development curves for both East and West are almost flat.** Progress was incredibly slow, with long periods of rise and fall, but no sustained breakthrough.
- **Around 1800 AD, the trajectory changes dramatically.** The Western curve suddenly shoots upward "like a rocket," entering a period of explosive growth. The Eastern curve follows this rapid ascent later, starting in the 20th century.

This visualization of history provides the central puzzle that the rest of Part One will explain: What caused this sudden, hockey-stick-shaped takeoff in human development after millennia of stagnation? Why did it happen first in the West, and why has the East now begun to follow a similar path?
