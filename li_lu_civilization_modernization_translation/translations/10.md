The Imperial Examination System fundamentally assessed individuals based on their learning ability, knowledge level, and administrative capability. It provided opportunities to all through a fair, transparent, and open manner, unrestricted by family background or bloodline, selecting outstanding and capable talents from various social strata. Political power was shared based on examination results. Furthermore, it unified the official ideology through government-conducted examinations to ensure the loyalty of the recruited talents to the regime. This selection and assessment system could guarantee that the chosen talents possessed comprehensive abilities, could serve the people, and would pledge allegiance to the regime. Civil officials managed military officials, ensuring the regime faced no challenges. Ideologically, the scholar-officials were loyal both to the imperial authority and political tradition, and to the Confucian moral tradition. They served the people, the imperial power, and also pursued personal ideals and ambitions, supporting their families and securing legacy for their descendants. This was almost a perfect institutional attempt.

The Imperial Examination System originated from recommendations of the worthy during the Han Dynasty. After several centuries of practice, it was formally established as a system in the Sui Dynasty, providing the most solid guarantee for managing China's vast empire for the next one to two thousand years. This also formed the basis for China's resurgence after 400 years of warfare following the Han Dynasty, leading to the截然不同 fates of the East and West after the decline of the Han and Roman Empires. From around 500 AD to 1770 AD, China led the West by approximately 1200 years, and this innovation of the examination system was one of the important reasons aiding China's lead. The establishment of this system largely resolved the administrative problems of the vast empire for China, ensured long-term peace, formed large-scale trade markets, promoted technological exchange and widespread application, developed culture, and endowed China with the capacity to cope with famine, plague, and foreign invasions, allowing China to lead almost every other country in the world for over 1000 years thereafter. Even when the British Empire began to form during the Industrial Civilization era, it drew lessons from China's civil service system to establish its own. Today, whether it's the U.S. military or other governments or non-governmental organizations adopting civil service systems, they are all more or less influenced by China's Imperial Examination System.

Although the Imperial Examination System greatly resolved the governance issues of the empire, its core shortcoming was the selection of the emperor, the supreme leader. The fundamental purpose of inventing the civil service system was to perpetuate imperial rule. However, the emperor had to be succeeded by bloodline. If the emperor was capable and excellent, the entire empire's strength could be fully utilized, as repeatedly proven in the eras of Emperors Wen and Jing of Han, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and Emperor Taizu of Song. But bloodline cannot guarantee capability, nor can it prevent the throne from passing to incompetent offspring, thus failing to avert the emergence of weak or inept emperors. Under their rule, the regime inevitably descended into internal strife and corruption. The unstable succession of imperial power affected the rise and fall of dynasties. Yet, no matter how a dynasty innovated in management details, it maintained the Imperial Examination System as its fundamental political institution. This system has influenced Chinese politics from the Han and Tang Dynasties up to the present day.

Another significant legacy of the Axial Age revolution was the diversity of thought. In China, there was the contention of a hundred schools of thought with different ideas. In Greece, Aristotle's inquiries spanned science, metaphysics, law, governance, and logic, with widely varied content in rhetoric. The emergence of intellectual diversity, especially the development of the rational branch, gave rise to another important trajectory of thought. Thought was not merely a means to establish a fair society and polity or to comfort the soul; starting from the Greek ideal of "knowledge for knowledge's sake," thought itself became an end pursued by humanity. Humanity's progress in thought gradually developed into modern science, beginning true mastery over the world. This branch of rational thought pointed humanity towards another great direction for development.

**The Discovery of the American Continent and its Epoch-Making Impact**

During the Agricultural Civilization era, geographical location was always a weakness for Western Europe. Although the center of the West had shifted from the Middle East to the Mediterranean and Southern Europe, Northwestern Europe remained very backward. Moreover, it was very far from the prosperous China and India. In the 15th century, Europeans, fascinated by Marco Polo's description of a heavenly China, hoped to open trade routes with India and China. The main trade routes between the West and the East were overland via the Middle East, which was then occupied by Muslims and difficult to pass due to wars between Christianity and Islam. The only ones able to trade were scattered European merchants, like the Venetians, trading mainly in Indian spices. To find sea routes to India and China, the West embarked on the Age of Discovery. Portugal's Vasco da Gama first established a route around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Then, Columbus set sail, hoping to find Asia directly by crossing the Atlantic, but accidentally discovered a completely new continent. He mistakenly thought he had reached India and called the local people Indians. This discovery not only changed European history but also彻底 altered the entire trajectory of human history.

Humans first entered the Americas around 15,000 BC, when ancestors who left Africa walked into the Americas via the land bridge from Siberia. However, after 12,000 BC, with the end of the Ice Age and global warming, sea levels rose, and this land bridge disappeared. Therefore, for over ten thousand years thereafter, the entire American continent, isolated by the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, was completely disconnected from other civilizations. Although its natural climatic conditions were good, it had very few wild plants and animals suitable for agriculture and animal husbandry; resources for agriculture and pastoralism were extremely scarce. There were only four plant species suitable for agriculture and not a single animal species suitable for domestication. The local high-yield crop, corn, was difficult to breed and required dozens of generations to improve. Therefore, its inherent conditions for developing agricultural civilization were extremely poor, its start was落后于 other places, the development speed of crop cultivation was extremely slow, and animal husbandry never developed at all, resulting in very low levels of social organization development.

When Europeans arrived, the American continent had only two larger polities in Mexico and South America, both relatively primitive. The relative advantage of European immigrants was obvious. By then, Europe, due to years of warfare, possessed rich combat experience and strong military organization capabilities, technologically with cast iron, firearms, and cannons. Therefore, the resistance of the local natives was doomed to fail. However, the most potent weapon the Europeans brought to the Americas was not cast iron, guns, or combat skills, but the germs they carried on their bodies and those on their livestock. In the past millennia, humans had gradually begun to gain the upper hand in the fight against germs, but at a惨烈 cost; the Black Death alone wiped out one-third of Europe's population at once. Other diseases, like smallpox, also killed nearly 10% of Europe's population during the Middle Ages. Although survivors had developed antibodies, these viruses and bacteria did not disappear and coexisted with humans and livestock. These germs were no longer potent for the battle-tested, antibody-carrying Europeans, but the Native Americans, who had never encountered them, had no resistance at all. Within just a few generations after Columbus reached the Americas, 75% of the local Native American population perished from these bacteria.

The already sparsely populated, low-end polity forms of the American continent were彻底摧毁 after the Europeans arrived, and the indigenous people were almost entirely wiped out by germs. In the early 16th century, Europeans found they had inherited a brand new continent. To their delight, this new continent had excellent natural conditions suitable for growing crops and developing animal husbandry. Moreover, the area of the New World was nearly nine times that of Western Europe, rich in natural resources like large amounts of silver and other mineral resources. This new continent彻底改变了 Europe's economic situation. From the 16th to the 18th century, Spain alone shipped back 50 tons of silver from South America. The discovery of the Americas also resolved Western Europe's land bottleneck at once, providing new possibilities for population movement, especially for marginalized and disillusioned people persecuted in their home countries or without inheritance rights; America quickly became a better出路 for them. Additionally, with America's fertile land suitable for growing any crop, Europeans traded a few luxuries for slaves in Africa, had the slaves cultivate sugar cane, cotton, and trees in America, shipped the agricultural products back to Europe, and sent new industrial products back to America. This process formed a huge, trans-Atlantic trade circle, rapidly invigorating the European economy after the 16th century and creating conditions for Europe to break through the agricultural economic bottleneck.

Different European colonial powers had different attitudes towards American immigration. Early colonial powers like Spain and Portugal were not mercantilist; their centralized monarchies treated their own merchants merely as cash cows, so the New World became a channel for the royal families to plunder and acquire silver. The Spanish royalty stipulated that anyone who conquered any place in America only needed to hand over 20% of the gains to the crown. The silver collected by the royalty was mainly used to fund centuries-long internal European wars. However, meanwhile, some Northwestern European countries began to approach the new Atlantic economy differently, most typically the Netherlands and England.

England, starting from the Magna Carta in 1215, continuously weakened royal power. Subsequently, Parliament continually took power from the crown. After the 15th century, any citizen with a certain amount of property could become a member of the House of Commons through election, so the Commons gradually became the representative of successful merchants. By the 17th century, after a series of civil wars between the Commons and the King, the modern parliamentary system was初步建立. In 1688–1689, after a bloodless coup, a Dutch prince ascended to the nominal throne and signed the Bill of Rights, marking the establishment of the first constitutional monarchy with a limited government in human history, and the emergence of the first mercantilist constitutional state. The power of this government lay mainly in the House of Commons, representing merchant interests; the propertied class could elect their own representatives to join, making England a mercantilist society in the 17th century. At this time, England's operations in North America exhibited a completely different model from Spain and Portugal's operations in South America. The immigrant nations established by England fundamentally aimed to represent merchant interests and protect private property. Immigrants to the New World also primarily sought wealth and religious freedom as ultimate goals. Under the influence and participation of England and its newly established immigrant nations, the Atlantic economy became a special, unprecedented economic form. At this time, with the support and protection of a limited government, a trans-Atlantic, global free market economy emerged, entirely controlled by free merchants and capitalists.

The formation of the American continent and the Atlantic economy posed a series of new questions for intellectuals across Europe. Due to the Age of Discovery and the discovery of the New World, people of this era began facing some fundamental technical problems, whether in geography, geology, biology, navigation technology, astronomy, or the origin of government, the nature of economy, etc., raising a series of new questions. European intellectuals of this time attempted to find the origins of these questions, hoping to understand the world through a mechanistic perspective. If the Renaissance a century or two earlier was about people hoping to find answers in the classics of past sages, during the Enlightenment, people were no longer satisfied with existing knowledge and strongly needed to propose a new system of knowledge and worldview to explain the new problems brought by the New World. They needed more reliable knowledge based on observation and experiment, verifiable repeatedly, and capable of prediction. It was under such strong social demand that Newton's publication of *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* in 1687 began a modern scientific revolution, bringing Europeans a全新的世界观 and opening a全新的时代. It understood the world as mechanical, predictable, and governed by principles and laws, like a clock. Under this worldview, people began to apply the same rational, scientific methods to critically examine almost all areas of human civilization—economy, politics, humanities, religion, culture, society—attempting to find their hidden laws. Thus began the Enlightenment, which lasted over a hundred years.

The new free market economy around the Atlantic, together with the Scientific Revolution, provided the fundamental conditions for the birth of modernity.

**The Birth of Modernity**

In the long river of history, there is often one year that is particularly special, where a series of important historical events concentrate, making that year a watershed of the era. 1776 was precisely such a year. In that year, three seemingly unrelated events occurred: Adam Smith published *The Wealth of Nations* in England, the American Founding Fathers issued the *Declaration of Independence*, and Watt announced the manufacture of the world's first steam engine in Birmingham. Together, these three events made this year a watershed for human civilization; thereafter, the entire human civilization leaped to a new stage once again.

The core issue discussed in Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* was the nature of the Atlantic economy. After the Atlantic economy had existed for over a century, Adam Smith wanted to know if such an economy, completely free from government regulation, could sustain success. This economic form was unprecedented. If not for the originally completely stateless condition of the American continent, if not for Britain's unique history, if British merchants had not rapidly become powerful social members due to the Atlantic economy, the British Parliament would not have had such strong power to dominate politics in the 17th century. The essence of this new economy was the formation of a trans-Atlantic free trade economy around the Atlantic, involving Britain, the Netherlands, and North America on the other side, characterized by limited government and complete capital dominance. Adam Smith himself was a moral philosopher, always considering issues from a moral perspective, especially social welfare. Therefore, he contemplated the free market's "invisible hand" from the perspective of social well-being. He attempted to prove that individuals, motivated entirely by self-interest without noble motives, through free competition, could make products more abundant, costs lower, and social resource allocation more efficient, thereby increasing the wealth of the entire society. This process is as if an invisible hand guides the entire society towards a more reasonable direction. This invisible hand corresponds to the government's visible hand.
