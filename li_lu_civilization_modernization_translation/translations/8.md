Today we can speculate that this civilizational leap might have originated from the gathering experiences of women at that time. As they gathered wild fruits, they might have wondered: if wild seeds were planted in fertile soil, would the harvest become more predictable? Archaeologists have found increasing evidence proving that humans began cultivating plants during this period, and further mastered a series of agricultural practices such as selecting superior varieties for hybridization, applying fertilizer, and weeding. The fruits produced in this way were no longer in their primitive wild state but transformed into a relationship of mutual dependence with humans, signaling the emergence of modern agriculture. The emergence of animal husbandry followed a similar process, with animals gradually being domesticated by humans. People first corralled certain wild beasts, then bred them, selected superior varieties for mating, and hand-reared the newborn animals. As a result, the domesticated animals could no longer survive independently in the wild but had to rely on a symbiotic relationship with humans.

The emergence of agriculture and animal husbandry was highly unevenly distributed globally, primarily due to completely different geographical environments and natural resources. The decisive role of geographical environment in agricultural civilization was first identified by biologist Jared Diamond. He points out that of the approximately 200,000 different species of flowering plants worldwide, only a few thousand are edible, and of those, only a few hundred can be artificially cultivated. About half of the energy intake for humans today comes from cereals, primarily wheat, corn, rice, barley, and sorghum. The wild ancestors of these cereals were neither widely nor evenly distributed globally. In nature, there are 56 species of wild plants with large, nutritious, edible seeds. Southwest Asia's Hilly Flanks zone had 32 of these species, East Asia (near China) had 6, Mesoamerica had 5, sub-Saharan Africa had 4, North America had 4, while Australia and South America each had only 2. All of Western Europe had just 1 species. Thus, the probability of agriculture emerging first in the Hilly Flanks was far greater than anywhere else. Looking at the conditions for animal husbandry: there are 148 species of terrestrial mammalian herbivores weighing over 100 pounds. By 1900, only 14 had been domesticated by humans. Of these, 7 wild ancestors were found in Southwest Asia, 5 in East Asia, and only 1 in South America. North America, Australia, and sub-Saharan Africa had none. The five most important domesticated animals in the world today—sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses—all except the horse originated in Southwest Asia. Although Africa has many animals, the vast majority, such as lions and giraffes, could not be domesticated. Therefore, judging from the distribution of agricultural resources, the Hilly Flanks zone was the luckiest place, followed by China's Yellow and Yangtze River basins. Although not as fortunate as the former, it was still the world's second-best region in terms of natural resources. Other regions of the world were far inferior to these two.

In fact, the emergence and spread of agricultural civilization as a whole were heavily influenced by natural resources. Agriculture began to appear around 9600 BCE in the Hilly Flanks and around 7500 BCE in China. Australia saw virtually no emergence of agriculture, and agricultural development in the Americas was also very delayed. The native plant of the Americas is teosinte, the ancestor of corn. Breeding teosinte into corn required dozens of generations of genetic mutation. The Americas also lacked native animals suitable for domestication, so the natural conditions for the start of agricultural civilization in the Americas were extremely scarce. Another reason for the lag in American agricultural civilization was geographical isolation. Human ancestors first crossed into the Americas from Eurasia via a land bridge around 15,000 BCE, but after about 12,000 BCE, the Americas and Eurasia were separated by oceans. Consequently, agricultural civilizations that emerged later in Eurasia could not spread to the Americas. Thus, the natural conditions for developing agricultural civilization in the entire Americas were poor, and they also lacked communication with other regions that had achieved agricultural civilization. In contrast, Western Europe, which also had poor natural conditions, saw agriculture cover the region by around 4000 BCE due to relatively accessible transportation links to the Middle East. In Asia, agriculture, originating in China from 7500 BCE onwards, spread in all directions, reaching present-day Southeast Asia, and by 1500 BCE, Korea and Japan, essentially covering all of Asia.

When agricultural populations moved into areas still reliant on hunting and gathering, competition arose. Agriculture itself represented progress in human civilization; societies at this stage of development could capture and utilize energy and organizational capabilities far exceeding those of Civilization 1.0. When civilizations of such disparate power encountered each other, the advanced civilization was bound to conquer the backward one. Civilization spread in two ways: one was colonization by the advanced civilization, the other was imitation and learning of the new production methods by indigenous people living in areas of backward civilization. Regardless of the method, the new civilization would eventually spread worldwide, and human lifestyles would gradually homogenize across different ethnicities. Today, nearly one in every four or five Europeans has ancestors originating from Southwest Asia and the Middle East, where agriculture first appeared. Although similar studies are lacking for Asia, based on both surveys of Asian populations and直观 observation, I believe the proportion of people with Chinese ancestors is probably similar.

Although fundamental human characteristics are largely the same, during the second civilizational leap, differences in natural conditions and opportunities for exchange with new civilizations led to variations in the speed and state of development. Geographical location, on one hand, determined a region's natural endowments, and on the other hand, determined its opportunities for exchange with the most advanced civilizations, thus creating developmental disparities between regions.

The most developed civilizations in the world today all developed from the two luckiest centers: one in Southwest Asia and the Middle East, and the other in China's Yellow and Yangtze River basins. The concepts of East and West also emerged at that time. Geographical location became very important from the agricultural civilization era onward. Places capable of exchanging with other regions, such as the Hilly Flanks, China, and Europe, developed in very similar ways, speeds, and trajectories, and the speed of civilizational spread was also comparable. For example, the sequence of emergence of various phenomena—from cultivation to selective breeding, to large villages, animal domestication, reorganization of lifestyles and family structures, ancestor worship, pottery making, and the formation of religious rituals—was remarkably similar among different populations. Although different regions developed different customs and cultures, from the perspective of civilizational development itself, given enough time, advanced civilizations would eventually spread to all accessible places through colonization, imitation, and assimilation. Thus, by around 1500 BCE, virtually all of Asia, the Middle East, North Africa along the Mediterranean, and Europe had entered the Civilization 2.0 stage. Due to innate deficiencies in natural resources and geographical isolation, the Americas and Australia failed to develop and remained largely in the Civilization 1.0 stage. In sub-Saharan Africa, limited animal husbandry emerged, but geographical conditions hindered the development of crop cultivation.

The origin, birth, development, and spread of agricultural civilization as a whole were closely related to geographical location. Both the initial natural conditions and the ease of exchange with other civilizational centers determined the timing and extent of local agricultural civilization. Africa's location near the equator fostered the birth of humanity there, and global warming allowed almost everywhere in the world to develop Civilization 1.0. However, when Civilization 2.0 arrived, the geographical conditions that were advantageous for Civilization 1.0 were not necessarily advantageous anymore; in many places, they even became disadvantages. The advantages Africa and America held in Civilization 1.0 turned into the biggest obstacles for Civilization 2.0. Regions with better conditions for agriculture naturally developed Civilization 2.0 faster, such as the Middle East and Southwest Asia. A 2000-year head start gave them a significant advantage, but this was not a permanent one. Both China and Europe gradually caught up with the leading Middle East later on, demonstrating that human potential is largely the same overall, while geographical location determines different conditions for development, leading to sequence variations.

In shaping the entire course of history, human animal nature played a very important role. Morris calls this Morris's Theorem: "History is the result of lazy, greedy, and frightened people looking for easier, safer, and more profitable ways to do things, without ever realizing they are changing their world." But at the same time, humans also demonstrated a powerful capacity for learning. Once natural conditions provided opportunities, they quickly transformed natural resource conditions into a great driving force for their own survival and development.

**The Ceiling of Agricultural Civilization and Three Attempts to Reach It**

The development of agricultural civilization led to a significant increase in population. Starting from around 10,000 BCE, the population began a long-term rise. Human reclamation and utilization of land continuously expanded, and land productivity also increased due to continuous improvements in agricultural technology. Around 5000 BCE, centralized hydraulic irrigation technology first appeared in the Mesopotamian plains of the Middle East. Subsequently, a series of intensive farming techniques began to be used in both East and West, such as crop rotation, seed selection, breeding, fallowing, improvements in farm tools, and the use of draft animals. Iron farm tools, waterwheels, and windmills also appeared during this time. To better utilize these new technologies, humans began to enhance their organizational capabilities, establishing cities, states, or even larger empires. Movement of populations, plunder, and wars occurred between city-states and nations. Contact between humans and animals, along with population movement, led to the spread of bacteria and plagues, triggering new wars. Simultaneously, population movement and new geographical discoveries also promoted trade and social division of labor. Large empires established stable, unified markets, allowing advanced technologies to spread faster over wider areas. Whether in organizational capability, institutional setup, or technological innovation, regions that took the initiative gained more advantages, challenged existing civilizational centers, turned their geographical advantages into disadvantages, and ultimately replaced old centers to become new ones. The entire Civilization 2.0 agricultural civilization advanced and developed in a pattern of 'two steps forward, one step back.'

Until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution, the trajectory of agricultural civilized societies always followed the cyclical pattern of "rise, peak, decline." After a period of development, society would reach a peak, simultaneously hitting a difficult-to-surpass ceiling, then inevitably decline, regress, rise again, peak again, decline again, and so on in a repetitive cycle.

Fundamentally, there was a ceiling to social development in agricultural civilization because it had an inherent bottleneck. Crops are produced by photosynthesis, and livestock also consume plants. The ratio of calories produced by animals to the plant energy consumed is 10:1. Therefore, the ultimate upper limit of energy producible by photosynthesis was constrained by land area and land productivity per unit area. Since both have upper limits, natural resources also have an upper limit. During this period, humans could not yet control population growth. An important way for humans to utilize new energy was to produce more offspring. Thus, finite resources and近乎 unlimited population growth determined that population increases could ultimately only be checked and absorbed by non-natural disasters. Starting from around 10,000 BCE, this fundamental bottleneck was a problem that agricultural society could never solve. Throughout the history of Civilization 2.0, especially in recent millennia, the矛盾 between making the pie and dividing the pie not only persisted but tended to intensify.

Overall, the disasters faced by humanity in the agricultural civilization era were primarily caused by these five factors: famine, war triggered by population movements, plague, climate change, and state failure. Land harvests were subject to weather; climate changes, both large and small, directly affected agricultural output. Minor changes led to harvest reductions, causing localized famines; long-term major changes would systematically reduce land yields in some regions, inevitably triggering large-scale population migrations, which in turn led to conflicts over resources and wars. Nomadic peoples, because their herds consumed large amounts of vegetation, were even more susceptible to weather changes, and their inherent mobility made them more inclined towards raiding and warfare. For thousands of years, the struggle for land between nomadic peoples and agricultural populations was a primary cause of war, and movements among agricultural populations themselves were also a major source of population flow. Another direct consequence of nomadic migrations for agricultural populations was the spread of bacteria and viruses, and the severe plagues that ensued, which were the most important cause of population reduction in history.

To meet these challenges, humans in both the Eastern and Western civilizational centers began to strengthen their organizational capabilities, leading to the emergence of cities, states, and empires. These social organizational innovations, on one hand, created peaceful environments, promoted the spread of technology and the expansion of trade within their territories, formed common markets, and fostered social development. On the other hand, the disparity between advanced states and backward regions also became a major cause of war, resource plunder, and conquest. Climate changes often highlighted the advantages of some regions, causing the center of civilization to shift. But simultaneously, the development of new civilizational centers brought new rounds of challenges, which in turn caused the civilizational center to migrate again. Geographical advantages and disadvantages constantly shifted, and the whole society advanced in the pattern of two steps forward, one step back.

From the historical trajectory, around 1300 BCE, social development in the West reached a regional peak, with the social development index increasing about sixfold compared to the beginning of agricultural civilization, while the East increased about fourfold. But at this point, the first pan-regional collapse occurred in the Western civilizational center—when several of the five major disasters appeared simultaneously, collapse was almost inevitable.

This failure caused Western development levels to regress over the next 200 years to what they had been 600 years prior. Meanwhile, the East continued to develop during this period. This was the first time the two major civilizational centers of East and West began to narrow the gap, and they subsequently exhibited astonishingly similar development patterns.

During this period, both major civilizational centers in Eurasia began to suffer invasions from northern nomadic peoples. These northern nomads were active along the steppe highway—a long corridor across Eurasia stretching from Northeast China and Mongolia in the east to Hungary in the west. For thousands of years, they remained the primary common enemy of both Eastern and Western agricultural civilizations. The struggle for land between agricultural civilizations and nomadic peoples never ceased, but Eurasia was also connected by the activity along this steppe highway...
