Another reason is China's unique political-economic system, referred to by some scholars as the "Tripartite Market Mechanism." As we mentioned in Part One, the Chinese were the earliest to explore methods of releasing collective strength and potential through political meritocracy. Over the past 40 years, China has brought this historical tradition to its fullest expression through its unique way of organizing the market economy. The so-called "Tripartite Market Mechanism" involves close cooperation between the central government, local governments, and enterprises. The central government sets strategy, provides resource support, and regulates the economic cycle – similar to the U.S. federal government in this regard. China's uniqueness lies in the competition among local governments. The behavior of Chinese local governments is more akin to corporate behavior; these "corporate-style local governments" provide headquarters-type services to real business companies. If a company invests and sets up a factory in a locality, the local government can provide it with land, build roads and bridges, organize labor, change tax systems, and can even purchase the first batch of products the company produces. Local governments do everything possible to help companies establish themselves locally and succeed. The companies only need to firmly grasp market opportunities. In exchange, companies employ large numbers of local workers, contribute to GDP, and pay taxes to the local government, though in a sense, this is more like paying rent, as it's equivalent to leasing a ready-made corporate headquarters. Meanwhile, different local governments compete with each other to provide better services for business companies, and together with the central government, they have facilitated long-term economic growth. As can be seen from Figure 18, the fluctuations in China's economic growth rate over the years have been very small. This unique model has generated exceptionally high growth rates over an extended period, with very minor cyclical changes. Of course, the small cyclical fluctuations are also related to a moderate international environment and an open free trade system.

However, in recent years, the situation has changed. First, when local governments act like enterprises providing business services, they demand rents, and some officials might even abuse their power for personal gain, demanding that companies pay rents directly to them as individuals. Therefore, while this model created ultra-high-speed economic growth, it also gave rise to serious corruption, rent-seeking, worsening environmental pollution, vicious competition between different regions, unsustainable wealth disparity, and an economy highly dependent on debt, as debt is one of the main methods the central government uses to moderate the ups and downs of the economic cycle. These are the drawbacks of the Tripartite Market Mechanism.

During this period, the international environment also changed. When China became the world's second-largest economy, the world's largest trading nation, and the largest industrial country, the economies of other countries and regions did not grow at 9% to accommodate so much output. Furthermore, one result of globalization is that those originally developed industrial powers are losing their industrial competitive foundation. The benefits brought by globalization to developed countries have been excessively concentrated and distributed to elites in the technology and finance sectors, leading to increasing wealth disparity and stagnant living standards for the middle class. Consequently, anti-globalization movements and various populist political movements began to gain momentum.

After 40 years of continuous economic growth, China's unique development model has also encountered difficulties.

**Part 3: Current Pessimism Towards China, Especially Among Overseas Investors**

Since the 18th National Congress, the Chinese government launched an anti-corruption campaign that is possibly the most comprehensive and enduring, lasting a full six years and more, and it is still ongoing. The government released a series of reform plans while pursuing two parallel policy goals. One goal is to strengthen control over the entire state and society through full and rigorous Party self-governance; the other goal is to simultaneously continue creating medium-to-high speed (relative to ultra-high speed) and sustainable economic growth for China.

But most people focus on the first goal, because the changes it brought are significant, affecting all bureaucratic institutions, all intellectuals, businesspeople, and every citizen. For a period, many found it difficult to adapt. It led to inaction or misconduct by some government officials, and even caused some enterprises and consumers to lose confidence in the future, leading to a significant drop in financial markets. This was the backdrop for the successive "black swan" events in China in 2018.

The outbreak of the Sino-US trade war during this period added insult to injury. Internationally, a new round of theories about "The Coming Collapse of China" became popular again. This phrase originated from Gordon Chang's 2001 book "The Coming Collapse of China." This prediction has resurfaced multiple times since, reiterated every few years by foreign renowned newspapers, magazines, entrepreneurs, and politicians. Within China, there are also quite a few who hold this view. Recently, we have encountered a new wave of pessimism, with a new round of predictions about China's imminent collapse. Those who hold this view doubt the ultimate goals of the policy of full and rigorous Party self-governance, and even question the government's determination to promote market economy reform and development. Does this signal the end of China's ultra-high-speed growth?

But thinking conversely, strengthening the Party's leadership has also brought about a more stable government, a stable country, and a stable, continuous, unified, and single large market. The anti-corruption campaign has also effectively curbed corruption and rent-seeking, uprooting some deeply entrenched interest groups, thereby making possible some economic reforms that were originally difficult to implement. We have also seen China continuously increasing investment in technology, education, and the environment. The Chinese economy is also transitioning from being export and investment-driven to being最终消费导向 (final consumption-oriented). In recent years, we have seen many changes in society. In some aspects, the space for public discourse has narrowed, but in other aspects, these policies have been highly effective, such as in poverty alleviation and environmental protection, where the results can be described as immediate. These are the changes that have occurred in China's domestic environment in recent years.

Internationally, let's discuss the trade war again. Many people ask whether this trade war signals the end of China's growth cycle. Let's look at the data. Figure 16 shows China's net exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. It is calculated by subtracting the value of imports of goods and services from the value of exports of goods and services, then dividing by GDP. In some historical periods, China's net exports were very high, close to 9% of GDP. It has also been as low as -4%. But in the past five years, China's net exports have averaged around 2%.

Looking at Figure 20, you will understand the changing influence of international trade on China's economic growth in recent years. Figure 20 shows the contribution rates of final consumption, investment, and net exports of goods and services to China's GDP growth since 2003. Over a decade ago, net exports contributed significantly to China's GDP. This began to decline in 2008 and 2009 (when China was the major importer supporting other global economies). In the past five years, the contribution of final consumption has continuously increased, the contribution of gross capital formation (i.e., investment) has relatively decreased, while the contribution of net exports has significantly decreased. In other words, the Chinese economy's dependence on foreign markets has significantly decreased. China's supply-side economic reforms have yielded tangible results. Shrouded in various worries, fears, complaints, and predictions, the Chinese economy is actually undergoing quiet changes. In 2018, the contribution rate of final consumption to GDP growth reached 76.2%, the contribution rate of gross capital formation was 32.4%, and the contribution rate of net exports of goods and services was -8.6%. While the Sino-US trade conflict will certainly cause damage and many negative impacts on the Chinese economy, it is no longer sufficient to halt China's sustained economic growth.

**Part 4: Three Different Stages of Economic Development: The Positions of China and the West Today**

In development economics, the Lewis Turning Point is an important concept. In the early stages of industrialization, surplus labor from the countryside is continuously attracted to urban industry. However, as industry develops to a certain scale, the rural surplus labor population shifts from surplus to shortage – this turning point is called the Lewis Turning Point. This observation was first proposed by the British economist W. Arthur Lewis in the 1950s.

Before the arrival of the Lewis Turning Point, that is, during the early process of urban industrialization, capital holds absolute control. Labor generally has little pricing power or bargaining ability. But because there are many surplus people in the countryside and many job seekers, companies naturally exploit workers.

After passing the Lewis Turning Point, the economy enters a mature stage of development. At this time, enterprises need to increase investment in production equipment to raise output, while also catering to and satisfying employee demands, increasing wages, improving working environments and production equipment, etc. During this period, because the labor force has begun to shrink, economic development leads to continuously rising wage levels. Rising wages, in turn, cause consumption levels to rise, and savings and investment levels also rise, thus increasing company profits, forming a mutually reinforcing, upward positive cycle. In this stage, almost everyone in society can enjoy the fruits of economic development, and a consumer society dominated by the middle class will form. The entire country enters a golden age of economic development. Therefore, this stage is also called the Golden Era.

Today's economy is a globalized economy. When the golden state persists for a period and wages rise to a certain level, it becomes more attractive for companies to produce in other emerging economies overseas. At this point, companies gradually begin to shift investment to developing countries, which then begin their own industrialization process. If this happens on a large scale in the home country, domestic investment decreases, and the wages of domestic laborers, especially low-skilled laborers, stop rising or even fall. In this stage, the economy is still developing, but the fruits of economic development are no longer distributed evenly across all social strata. Labor must fend for itself. Jobs with higher technical content, such as in science and technology, finance, and international markets, yield high returns, and overseas returns on capital are also high. But overall wage levels in society stagnate, and domestic investment opportunities greatly diminish. The American economist Richard Koo calls this stage the "Post-Lewis Turning Point, Being-Chased Stage."

Today, major Western countries roughly began to enter the aforementioned third stage (the being-chased stage) gradually in the 1970s. As for former emerging countries that were in the catching-up phase, such as Japan, they also began to enter the being-chased stage after the 1990s. For China, although different observers propose different specific times, generally China should have passed the Lewis Turning Point in the past few years and begun to enter the mature stage of economic development. As shown in the following charts, China's wage levels, consumption levels, and investment levels in recent years have all begun to show accelerating growth trends.

During different stages of economic development, the government's macroeconomic policies have different functions. In the early industrialization process, fiscal policy plays a huge role. Investing in infrastructure, resources, and export-related services helps emerging countries rapidly enter an industrialized state. After entering the mature stage post-Lewis Turning Point, economic development mainly relies on domestic consumption. Private sector entrepreneurs at the forefront of the market are better able to grasp rapidly changing market opportunities. At this time, further investment relying on fiscal policy begins to conflict and compete for resources with private sector investment. In this period, monetary policy can more effectively mobilize the initiative of the private sector and promote economic development. Upon reaching the being-chased stage, because the domestic investment environment deteriorates and investment opportunities decrease, and because overseas investment yields higher returns, the private sector is unwilling to invest domestically. At this point, the government's fiscal policy becomes more important again, as it can compensate for insufficient domestic private sector investment, excessive household savings, and insufficient consumption. Conversely, monetary policy often becomes ineffective in this stage.

However, because government inertia is relatively strong, often when the economic development stage changes, policy implementation remains stuck in the successful experiences of the previous development stage. For example, in the West today, macroeconomic policy still primarily relies on monetary policy, which was more effective during the Golden Era. But judging from actual results, the effectiveness of these policies is very low, to the extent that in many Western countries today, especially in Europe and Japan, despite ultra-loose monetary policy, zero or even negative interest rates, the inflation rate remains very low, and economic growth remains extremely slow. Similarly, as the Chinese economy has begun to enter the mature stage post-Lewis Turning Point, the government's fiscal policy remains very strong, and the government's use of monetary policy is still relatively weak. In the past few years, private enterprises have been squeezed to some extent by various fiscal policies and state-owned enterprises, showing a trend of narrowing space in certain fields. This phenomenon of misalignment between macroeconomic policies and the stage of economic development occurs in various countries at different stages.

Nevertheless, it is undeniable that China is still in the Golden Era of economic development, still maintains a cost advantage over developed Western countries, and the other emerging developing countries behind it...
