At that moment, you won't have the courage to buy heavily. It seems like you're losing everything, and all those so-called "smart people" are laughing at you, but you must have self-confidence. The pillar supporting this self-confidence is accurate and complete information.

The second very important point is that the vast majority of returns, most of the money you earn in your lifetime, will not come from the kind of companies we just discussed. These investments will only give you some bread, allow the basic business to operate, and provide a decent rate of return. They won't give you an exceptionally high rate of return. Even if both of these companies rise five or six times, it still doesn't count as an ultra-high return rate. If you are a true value investor, you will basically follow one of these two schools: Tweedy Browne and Benjamin Graham represent one school; the other school is Buffett and Munger. The latter is what I'm more interested in. If you want to follow this path, your returns will come from a few insights, and the number will definitely not be large—you can count them on both hands. After exhausting a lifetime of effort over 50 years, you might only get a few truly significant insights. But the insights you gain are unique, ones that no one else has. Where do these insights come from? There's only one way: with endless curiosity and a strong desire for knowledge, continuously learn, engage in lifelong learning. Every piece of knowledge you learn is useful.

**Bruce:** A student asks if there were any particular mistakes in your research process?

I make mistakes whenever I violate any one of the three principles of value investing. When the information I obtain is not accurate enough, or not complete enough, I make mistakes; when I think I have gained an insight but it turns out not to be one at all, I make mistakes. I've made many mistakes. Basically, I don't like to dwell on mistakes already made. To be honest, perhaps my biggest mistake was not buying more of a company after I identified it correctly. Another mistake was the detours I took early in my career. Soon after I started my firm, the performance was excellent, but I couldn't find clients to invest money. In every conversation, clients couldn't understand. "We want to make money every month, even every week! We want to make money even in a bear market! That's why we hired you. We want you to be as safe as a bank but provide higher returns. Aren't you called a hedge fund?" I had no choice. So for about two years, fortunately not too long, I also started doing hedge trading, moved to Julian Robertson's office, began learning the tricks of these top hedge fund managers, and even hired someone to handle short selling. But actually, you know this set of operations is meaningless. I was also extremely busy because short selling requires constant trading; you have no choice because your profit potential is limited to the short amount, while the losses have no lower limit. It got to the point where I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, unable to focus on those opportunities stemming from insights. As Charlie says, it's like tying your hands to compete in an ass-kicking contest; that's exactly what it was. During that time, I actually had several excellent opportunities—companies I knew very well, for which I had my own unique insights, and I even knew the management of these companies. Their market capitalization was below net cash, and later their market cap grew 50-100 times, yet I missed these opportunities because I couldn't devote myself fully at that time. Profound insight and frequent trading are incompatible. This was my biggest mistake, not so much about how much money I failed to make, but that I missed the opportunities. Of course, I also make mistakes, and I make them from time to time. A common mistake is when you haven't thoroughly completed your homework, you simply can't resist the excitement about an idea. Like with Timberland, I couldn't help but buy some at $28, but the research wasn't actually finished yet; I just felt I was probably right. Of course, after thoroughly completing the research, I greatly increased my purchase amount. It's also possible that after completing the research, you find you were wrong; by then the price might have already dropped 20-30%, but it's not a big deal. Accept your misjudgment and continue looking for new opportunities. As long as you leave a sufficient margin of safety, the probability of winning is certainly high. Over a long enough time, your returns won't be bad. Such losses are nothing. But if in an area where you have deep insight, an opportunity arises and you don't make a heavy bet, that is a huge mistake. I cannot forgive myself for making such a mistake. (Bruce asks: Can you name these companies?) No. (Audience laughs) Because I might still have the opportunity to invest in them in the future.

I assure you, in your entire life, you might only get 5 or 10 insights. It might take many years of learning to generate just one. Some things I am studying and researching today, I actually started learning about 15 years ago. I was researching American companies back then, and now I've discovered similar companies in Asia, with good valuations, positioned where I'm willing to make heavy bets. But you need to know, I started researching this field 15 years ago, and I am thoroughly familiar with all the knowledge in this field. You need to build such insights to be absolutely confident in your judgment. If you can't do it, it might be due to an unsuitable personality, or perhaps insufficient effort, so you won't have the chance to truly earn huge wealth. You can learn from Graham and Dodd and achieve an annualized return of 10% to 15%. Such performance already surpasses the vast majority (95%) of investors, including those so-called professional investors. But you cannot achieve the uniquely outstanding performance of someone like Buffett. In your entire life, you might not find such opportunities—opportunities that allow your wealth to grow a thousand or even ten thousand times. Needless to say, such opportunities are extremely rare; don't think you can easily obtain them. It requires you to synthesize a large number of factors. Munger named this inspiration the Lollapalooza effect—conscious, subconscious, psychological, political... all these factors combined and integrated, then a spark of insight emerges, making you the only one with the insight, the only one with the confidence to place a heavy bet. Investing with complete, accurate information and unique insights is what truly attracted me to this industry. It's exciting, extremely exciting. You must learn everything. When I started studying, I learned physics and mathematics. After entering Columbia, I studied economics, history, law, politics, etc. I was very interested in all these. You also need this kind of passion. You might also need some knowledge and thinking patterns from biology. My wife has a Ph.D. in biology, and I learned a lot of biological knowledge from her. Some of it has even helped my investing, though she might not know it. You must learn everything, must be curious about everything. In this long process, you will occasionally encounter a big opportunity. And between these big opportunities, you will from time to time catch opportunities like Timberland, Hyundai Department Store H&S, and get decent returns.

**Student:** How many companies do you invest in per year?

It depends. Counting it this way might not be meaningful. It's possible to go several years without encountering an opportunity, and there are also years when opportunities emerge one after another. It depends on which companies are within your circle of competence and also appropriately valued. But I can assure you, opportunities do not appear uniformly. Expecting to have one investment idea every quarter or every month is unrealistic; my experience isn't like that either. I started investing 15 years ago when I was still studying at Columbia. In the first five or six years, I probably had three or four relatively big investment ideas. These investments were very profitable, but averaging them out isn't meaningful. After that, I started to progress. The process of investment learning has a compounding effect. You'll find your skills becoming more and more proficient. Maybe you can glance at a page of the Moody's manual and get a general idea in just a few minutes. The sensitivity to opportunities is the same, so perhaps later you can catch more opportunities. But it's also possible that the market is very uncooperative, and no opportunities appear for a whole year. That's all fine. But what I cannot accept the most is wasting time—a year passes without learning anything, without generating a single insight (even a self-perceived one), and without overturning past erroneous insights. This is what I cannot accept. So you must keep learning every day without stopping, treat it as a mental discipline to execute.

**Student:** How did you make a living when you first arrived in the US?

I wrote a book, earned some money, and someone paid to adapt the book into a script and make a movie. But my net worth was still negative because I had borrowed a lot of money. Fortunately, I had some cash. Although insolvent, student loans didn't need to be repaid immediately, so I was lucky to have cash for investing.

How to find investment ideas? Actually, I look for ideas while reading many books. I read biographies, physics, my favorite history—all can bring me inspiration. I look for opportunities while reading. If an opportunity comes, I will go all out to research it. In my spare time, I mainly spend time with my two daughters, and of course, my wife. My daughters are three and a half and one and a half years old. I also learn from them, observing how human cognitive abilities develop. Returning to my investment thought process: Is this business cheap? Is it a good business? Who is running it? What else have I missed? When you examine the last item, you'll find knowledge in psychology and human cognition is particularly important. There's no better place to observe the process of human cognitive development than in children. So playing with my two daughters and observing their growth and cognitive development is also beneficial for investment. All knowledge is useful for investment.

I want to emphasize one more point. I mentioned earlier that the difference between value investors and other investors lies in seeing themselves as business owners, focusing on the long term, and seeking a margin of safety. Actually, these three points all stem from the same one: seeing yourself as the business owner. Because you are a prudent businessperson and cannot control the management, you need to protect yourself and seek a large margin of safety. Since you are the holder of the business, you naturally focus more on long-term performance, etc. It's all the same thing. Some people ask me, if you are the business owner, why do you still buy stocks? The stock market is not set up for business owners; it's set up for traders; it attracts traders. That's why those 95% of people never think and trade based on these three principles. Let's assume all investors were value investors, then would there even be a stock market? Of course not. Who would buy IPOs? Without a primary market, where would the secondary market come from? If everyone required a huge margin of safety, who would sell to you? This is also why I started by talking about these basic points. You, if you are value investors, essentially do not belong to the stock market. You must always remember this, find your own position, and not be influenced by others. Further assuming, if you are truly a natural businessperson, you will eventually be attracted to becoming a real businessperson, operating an enterprise. This is also why Buffett left the asset management industry, and Munger did too. After running their partnership for over ten years, they started acquiring businesses and truly operating them. People with this mindset might also go into private equity. This is actually a more industrial way of thinking, an evolution. Value investors with this mindset can always find profitable things to do. Even though the market is not set up for them, they can always find opportunities to make money. The reason is that the market is set up for the 95% who love trading. These people inherently have weaknesses; they always want to trade. Once you are keen on trading, you will inevitably make mistakes. Your emotions, personal desires, and biases will be exposed; fear, greed, these inherent traits will also cause you to make mistakes. Once they make mistakes and the market fluctuates, your opportunities come.

**Student:** How do you find the right time to sell?

This is a very interesting question. I myself have evolved on this issue. I used to have a principle: if I wouldn't buy at a certain price, I could sell. Now I feel I have evolved a bit because when I have an insight into a certain field or company, I truly feel I am the owner of the business. Even if someone says you should sell, the price is already high, and indeed I wouldn't be willing to buy at this price anymore,但从长期来看, my insight and deep understanding of this company and industry tell me the odds of winning are still high. This business will get better and better. Good businesses just keep getting better. The managers of these businesses have huge capital advantages. In some industries, this is an absolute advantage. So at such times, I have other considerations. First, I need to consider whether there's a chance to buy back after selling. Second, there are huge taxes to pay. These taxes payable are essentially like an interest-free loan from the government. As long as you don't sell, this interest-free leverage remains. The tax rate might be 30%, even as high as 40-50%. You can use this 40-50% interest-free capital to enhance your investment, no margin calls, no repayment deadline. Assuming the company uses its capital wisely, their returns can be more than 15%. I find many excellent companies have returns on invested capital as high as 50%-100%. At this point, the math becomes more interesting; you find the growth rate exceeds your imagination. So confidence is very important, and you need to have confidence that your judgment and predictions will be correct over a very long period. Let me emphasize again, you might only encounter such opportunities a few times in your life. If you are confident you can see clearly ten years ahead, that's already outstanding. Those people working in investment banks think they can predict the endless future—do you think that's possible? It's simply a fantasy! Everyone knows they can't even predict tomorrow, how can they predict the next 5 or 10 years? And predict forever? What they do is meaningless. But I guarantee, if you have decent talent, a suitable personality, plus hard work, and use your whole life to learn, maybe in the next fifty years of investment career you can find 5-10 opportunities. In these opportunities, you have your own unique insights and can predict the next ten or twenty years more accurately than others. At that point, you simply won't want to sell. What reason is there to sell? The government lends you money interest-free and won't ask for it back. The company's ROIC is 40-100%. This is a very tax-efficient allocation, so you wouldn't sell.

**Student:** Then why did you sell Timberland?

Because it didn't have these characteristics; it's not among the outstanding companies. I have some companies in my current portfolio that are in this category, but I won't talk about those companies.

**Bruce:** Can you summarize the common characteristics of such outstanding companies?

The competitive advantages of these enterprises will continuously strengthen, strengthen, and strengthen again. Everyone can try to find some examples.
