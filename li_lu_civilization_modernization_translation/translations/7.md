**Signs**

This, then, is the trajectory of nearly 16,000 years of human civilization in both the East and the West. Subsequent chapters will focus on explaining the causes behind this trajectory of human civilization, the similarities and differences in the development of Eastern and Western civilizations, the reasons for the rocket-like rapid development of society after 1800 AD, and further comparisons between East and West. This will further explain why the West was able to dominate the world in modern times and explain China's lag in the modern era. Only by understanding the historical trajectory and its causes can we answer the question of how China can catch up with the West today, summarize the characteristics of China's modernization, and look into the future of both East and West.

**The First Leap of Human Civilization**

Ian Morris's charts of the social development index clearly show the continuously rising trend of human civilization's evolutionary trajectory, with the curve's amplitude also indicating different rates of ascent in different eras. Social development always rises in a curved line amidst fluctuations, and the fluctuations of each historical stage have their own patterns. The history of human social development has always maintained an upward trend, but the speed and characteristics vary at different stages. Therefore, I believe that to understand the evolution of human civilization, it is necessary to divide it into different stages for separate analysis.

I define civilization as the totality of achievements created by humans utilizing their own resources and those in their environment for survival and development, intending to measure the distance opened up between humans and their closest animal ancestors. Another concept often confused with civilization is culture. Culture refers to the unique ways of life, habits, and beliefs formed by people living in different regions over long periods of time. Culture is used to distinguish between different regions and different groups of people, while civilization is used to describe the commonality of human development and to distinguish humans from their animal ancestors. In the long river of human history, industrial civilization opened a new historical stage, and the arrival of agricultural civilization also brought a new historical stage. Before the emergence of agricultural civilization, the main modes of human production were gathering and hunting. Based on the different modes of human production, I broadly divide the developmental stages of human civilization into three parts: the Gathering-Hunting Civilization or Civilization 1.0, the Agricultural-Pastoral Civilization or Civilization 2.0, and the Technological Civilization heralded by the Industrial Revolution, or Civilization 3.0.

In the era of Civilization 1.0, the way humans gathered and used energy seemed largely unchanged and not very different from other hunting animals.

But this is a misunderstanding. Humanity's Civilization 1.0 actually began around 70,000 years ago, triggered by a massive leap forward caused by climate change.

To understand human characteristics, one must understand the environment in which humans live. The Earth has a history of 4.5 billion years, life has only about 1.5 billion years of history, and humans have only 150,000 years of history. The impact of the natural environment on all living beings is crucial, with climate being the most significant influencing factor.

The Earth's climate began a major change about over 50 million years ago, when the movement of continental shelves caused most landmasses to shift to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving the Southern Hemisphere predominantly oceanic. Another change occurred around 14 million years ago, when volcanic activity forming continental shelves basically ceased, and the Earth's temperature subsequently dropped, leading to the formation of perennial snow accumulation in Antarctica. Because there is no continental shelf at the North Pole, snow melted more easily, so perennial snow cover did not form there until 2.75 million years ago. Against this backdrop, Milankovitch cycles began to exert a periodic influence on the Earth's present-day climate. The Earth's orbit around the sun is not perfectly circular; due to the gravitational pull of other planets, it is often elliptical. Additionally, the Earth's rotation axis is tilted and undergoes precession. Influenced by these three factors, the Earth's climate forms three major cycles with periods of 26,000 years, 41,000 years, and 96,000 years. These three cycles cause variations in the amount of solar heat received by the Earth, creating glacial and interglacial periods.

There have been 40 to 50 ice ages in history, with the most severe two occurring 190,000 years ago and 90,000 years ago. This period played a key determining role in human origins and early development. During the most severe ice ages, glaciers from the Arctic Ocean alone covered Northern Europe, Asia, and America. Most of the Earth's surface water was absorbed into glaciers, the Earth became very dry, and sea levels were 300 feet lower than today. Furthermore,

glaciers reflected sunlight back into the atmosphere, leading to even lower temperatures, a reduction in plants and animals, less atmospheric CO2 for the greenhouse effect, and a further drop in temperature. *Homo sapiens*, the ancestors of modern humans, appeared around 150,000 years ago. The harsh climatic conditions of this period confined them to very limited areas near the equator in Africa. Most geneticists and archaeologists believe that the total human population dropped to around 20,000 at one point, showing no signs of future global conquest. This was the darkest era in human history. However, around 70,000 years ago, human fortune began to change. The Milankovitch cycles shifted in the opposite direction, making eastern and southern Africa warmer and more humid, providing humans with better natural conditions for hunting and gathering. The population also began to grow rapidly with the increase in food. It was also at this time that humans, as a unique animal, began to show their true advantages.

From their very emergence, humans showed significant differences from other animals, even their "close relatives" the anthropoid apes. This distinction was not fully apparent before the climate warmed, but once climate created favorable conditions, humans began to demonstrate enormous advantages. Compared to other animals, humans' biggest characteristics are their large brain capacity and superior computational ability. Although the brain is only 2% of body weight, it consumes 20% of the body's energy. If humans were born only after the brain was fully mature, mothers would be utterly unable to give birth. To solve this problem, humans must give birth prematurely, before the fetal brain is fully developed. This is different from all other mammals. Whether cattle, horses, sheep, lions, or tigers, these animals can quickly stand, grow, live, and even hunt independently after birth. But humans are born far from maturity and independent living, requiring several years to stand, walk, speak, and for the brain to fully mature. Therefore, human infant mortality was high, but the advantages after maturity were also obvious. When the climate became favorable for life, human

advantages became particularly prominent. This advantage was fully manifested in the first great leap of human civilization, namely the leap out of Africa.

Due partly to climate change and partly to influences from their original living environment, human ancestors began to leave Africa, departing their original homeland for entirely new living environments. This civilizational leap displayed from the outset the unique ambition and intelligence of humans as an animal. Starting from 60,000 BC, humans moved from Somalia in Africa into Arabia, to Eurasia, then from North Africa into Europe, from Eurasia into Eastern Asia, from southern Asia into Australia, from Eurasia across Alaska into North America, and from North America into South America.

**Figure 4** roughly shows the routes of human migration at that time. Over a period of about forty to fifty thousand years, human footprints basically covered the entire globe. As the climate continued to warm, more places saw an increase in plants and animals, providing opportunities for hunting and gathering humans to survive in various parts of the world. Although nature created the same conditions for all species, not all species possessed the strong ambition of humans to overcome numerous difficulties and traverse the globe. This journey is astonishing and unimaginable even by today's standards. Imagine our ancestors crossing vast glaciers and oceans, generation after generation, with tenacious determination, occupying the entire globe without any knowledge of the future or their destinations. From 60,000 BC until around 12,000 BC, over tens of thousands of years, humans set out from Africa and eventually reached the southernmost tip of South America, spreading across the entire Earth at an average speed of one mile per year. At this time, their main tool was stone, and their means of transport was their own legs. There was no agriculture, no animal husbandry, no reliance on other animals, and no other tools; they advanced solely by hunting and gathering along the way, organized in small groups. This expedition of our ancestors remains震撼 (shocking) and激动人心 (thrilling) to contemplate today.

The question of whether the *Homo sapiens* who left Africa were indeed the ancestors of all modern humans was a subject of academic debate until it was conclusively resolved in the 1990s. In 1987, geneticist Rebecca Cann and her team first reached a breakthrough conclusion. By conducting a global study of mitochondrial DNA, which is only carried by females and inherited exclusively through the female line, Rebecca Cann discovered the following conclusions: First, genetic diversity is greater in Africa than anywhere else in the world; Second, the genetic diversity found elsewhere is all a subset of the diversity found in Africa; Third, the oldest mitochondrial DNA scientists could trace came from Africa. These three findings all pointed to the same conclusion: the entire world shares a common female ancestor who lived in Africa, known as "African Eve." Subsequent studies have, to varying degrees, confirmed Cann's findings, albeit pushing back the time of African Eve's appearance

to around 150,000 years ago. By the 1990s, other geneticists, by examining the Y chromosome which is only passed down among males, reached almost the same conclusion: that the common ancestor of all modern human males also came from Africa, known as "African Adam." Therefore, by the 1990s, the debate about whether *Homo sapiens* were the ancestors of all modern humans was answered. The common ancestors of all of us today are the descendants left around the globe by the *Homo sapiens* who walked out of Africa. Almost all other hominins and anthropoid apes became extinct within tens of thousands of years after humans left Africa.

After leaving Africa, humans left traces of civilization along their journey, one of the most famous being the cave paintings at Altamira (Cueva de Altamira), which are 18,500 years old. The astonishing artistic achievement and creativity of these paintings are such that Picasso, after visiting them, reportedly sighed: "None of us today can paint like this." He felt that compared to these paintings, all subsequent human works represented a regression.

Later archaeological discoveries, including paintings, stone tools, and women's ornaments left along the path of human migration across the globe, all reflect human creativity and intelligence. Although humans at their inception were also gatherers and hunters, seemingly not much different from their animal ancestors, they displayed strong ambition and creativity. Even other anthropoid apes did not, like humans, walk across glaciers and oceans within a mere few tens of thousands of years, leaving their footprints all over the globe; nor did they, like humans, leave behind their imagination and creativity everywhere. This determination, drive, pursuit of meaning, and artistic expression are not possessed by other anthropoid apes. Humanity's strong

ambition and superior intelligence set them apart from any other animal from this point onward.

This human migration out of Africa and subsequent coverage of the globe, while not causing massive changes in lifestyle, led to rapid population growth from an initial 20,000 or so. More importantly, humans had spread to all parts of the world. When global climate began to change, offering new developmental opportunities for life, humans were already prepared to seize these opportunities. Therefore, this exodus from Africa marked humanity's first great civilizational leap, significantly reducing the risk of extinction, greatly increasing genetic diversity and adaptability, and initiating a global search for the living conditions most suitable for human development. When such conditions first appeared in certain regions of the Earth, humanity's ability to seize opportunities was fully formed, and the foundation for a new leap had been solidly laid.

**The Birth of Agricultural Civilization**

The last Ice Age on Earth ended around 20,000 BC. Meltwater from glaciers flowed into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise; by 14,000 BC, glacial melting had stopped. Around 12,700 BC, the Earth's temperature had risen to within a few degrees of today's temperature. This temperature was particularly suitable for the survival of animals and plants. The variety and quantity of Earth's flora and fauna increased rapidly, and for our human ancestors relying on gathering and hunting, food sources naturally increased substantially. From 18,000 BC to 10,000 BC, the total global human population increased more than tenfold from less than 500,000. From this time on, humans began to inherit the Earth and also to receive the gifts bestowed by the Earth.

Global warming was a gift from the Earth to humanity, but people living in different geographical locations did not enjoy the same fortune. The luckiest people lived on the "Lucky Latitudes," namely Eurasia between 20°N and 35°N, and the Americas between 15°N and 20°S. After 12,700 BC, various wild grains began to appear on both the eastern and western sides of Eurasia. These grains had large kernels, meaning that spending 1 calorie of energy to gather them could yield a 50-fold return when consumed. Benefiting from this abundance of food, the size of human communities began to expand, gradually forming centers of civilization. Soon, in the most developed region on the Lucky Latitudes, the Hilly Flanks zone—an arc of hilly land located between the Tigris-Euphrates and Jordan River valleys—human civilization's second great leap occurred率先 (taking the lead).

Today we can speculate that this civilizational leap might have originated from the gathering experiences of women at the time. As they gathered fruits, did they think: if wild fruits were planted in fertile soil, would the harvest be easier to predict? Archaeologists have found

increasing evidence that humans during this period began cultivating plants, and further mastered a series of agricultural practices such as selecting superior varieties for crossbreeding, applying fertilizer, and weeding. The fruits produced in this way were no longer in their primitive wild state but transformed into a relationship of interdependence with humans, signaling the emergence of modern agriculture. The emergence of animal husbandry followed a similar process, with animals gradually being domesticated by humans. People first corralled some wild beasts, then bred them, selected superior varieties for mating, and hand-reared the newborn animals, to the extent that the domesticated animals could no longer survive independently in
