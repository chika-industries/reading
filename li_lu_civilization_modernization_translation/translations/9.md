Changes often cause the advantages of certain regions to become apparent, leading to a shift in the center of civilization. However, the development of new centers of civilization simultaneously brings about a new round of challenges, which in turn causes the civilizational center to migrate once again. Geographical advantages and disadvantages constantly shift, and the entire society advances in a pattern of taking two steps forward and one step back.

Looking at the trajectory of history, around 1300 BC, social development in the West once reached a regional peak, with the social development index increasing about sixfold compared to the beginning of agricultural civilization, while in the East it increased about fourfold. However, it was at this time that the first region-wide collapse occurred in the Western civilizational center—when several of the five major calamities appeared simultaneously, collapse was almost inevitable.

This failure set Western development back over the next 200 years to the level of 600 years prior. Meanwhile, the East continued to develop during this period. This was the first time the two major civilizational centers of East and West began to close the gap, and they subsequently exhibited astonishing similarities in their development.

During this period, both major civilizational centers of Eurasia began to face invasions from northern nomadic peoples. At this time, the northern nomads were active along the grassland highway—a long Eurasian line stretching from Northeast China and Mongolia in the east to Hungary in the west. For thousands of years, they remained the primary common enemy of both Eastern and Western agricultural civilizations. The struggle between agricultural civilizations and nomadic peoples never ceased, but it was also through these nomads active on the grassland highway that Eurasia became connected.

Although agricultural civilization faced challenges, it attempted to reach its peak at least three times over millennia, constantly innovating in response to challenges. Institutional innovations during the agricultural civilization stage first included the evolution from low-level states to high-level states, mainly accomplished between 1000 BC and 200 BC. In the West, the transition progressed from low-level states to high-level polities represented by the Persian Empire of Darius, stretching from Syria to Thrace, then through the Greek city-states, finally culminating in the Roman Empire, which established a regime representing the highest level of Western achievement. Because the Roman Empire was located around the Mediterranean, it possessed a very convenient inland sea transportation route. Within the empire, a vast trans-Eurasian trade empire formed, allowing for optimal resource allocation. Social development reached the peak of agricultural civilization for the first time. From around 200 BC to the beginning of the Common Era, the Roman Empire entered its peak period. By this time, the social development index had increased about tenfold since the beginning of agricultural civilization. Meanwhile, in the East, after going through low-level states like the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and attempts at transitioning to high-level government during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the Qin and Han dynasties ushered in a high-level administrative regime of centralized power, also establishing a large trans-regional empire. Although the social development index was slightly lower than that of Rome at this time, it was still leading in the East.

After the first attempt to reach the peak of agricultural civilization, the five major challenges appeared almost simultaneously in both East and West. Particularly, the invasion of nomadic peoples, coupled with internal political failures and epidemics, led to the successive collapse of the two great empires East and West after their first peak attempt, causing a devastating regression across the entire civilized region. This regression lasted for over a thousand years in the West and about 400 years in the East. After 400 years, the East entered a golden age represented by the Tang and Song dynasties. The Eastern Empire of the Song Dynasty made the second attempt to reach the peak of agricultural civilization, achieving, even surpassing, the accomplishments of the Roman Empire. However, after this second peak attempt, agricultural civilization was once again defeated by nomadic peoples (the Mongol cavalry). The nomadic regime, combined with epidemics, led to the failure of the Song Dynasty's peak attempt. The Mongol armies swept across Eurasia, conquering almost all civilized states from China to Hungary, Russia, and the Middle East, and also brought plague to every corner of the world. Although this conquest destroyed the achievements of the Song Dynasty, it also spread the highly developed Eastern civilization represented by the Song to the relatively backward Western Europe of the time. The Song Dynasty had once reached a civilizational peak, with an annual pig iron production of about over 100,000 tons. It wasn't until 1700 that the total production of all of Europe reached this figure.

China's most important technological inventions at the time, such as cast iron, gunpowder, the compass, the spinning wheel, windmills, waterwheels, and agricultural techniques, all spread to Europe.

Another consequence of the Mongol conquest stemmed from what it did *not* achieve. The Mongol cavalry stopped abruptly after reaching Hungary and never reached Western Europe, so its destruction did not affect Western Europe. However, the technology did spread there, providing excellent conditions for Western Europe to become the next eruption point of civilization. Europe, embroiled in feudal wars after the Roman Empire, had failed in several attempts at unification. European polities, among hundreds of large and small feudal kingdoms and between the Christian Pope and the kingdoms, fought endless wars for a thousand years. Therefore, when Chinese firearms arrived, they were rapidly developed into muskets and cannons. These muskets and cannons, in turn, were transmitted back to the East. Centuries later, with the help of muskets and cannons, and through the joint efforts of Russia and the Qing Dynasty in the East and West, the nomadic populations that had ravaged agricultural lands for millennia were completely subdued. Around the 17th century, the grassland highway was effectively sealed off, marked by the Treaty of Nerchinsk between China and Russia in 1689. The vast majority of the grassland highway was allocated to Russia, and a significant portion to China. China's territory expanded from the original Yellow River and Yangtze River basins to include the Northeast, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, thus opening up new land frontiers and providing land resources for China's renewed social development—although the productivity of these newly opened lands was incomparable to that of the Yangtze and Yellow River basins.

Meanwhile, in the West, after the 15th century, Western Europe, which the Mongols had missed, began to show vibrant new vitality, with the Renaissance emerging in Venice and Florence. The introduction of Chinese technology to the whole of Western Europe sparked a new round of social development. The introduction of new Chinese technologies, coupled with Marco Polo's high praise for China, sparked the first real wave of Sinophilia in the West, leading Westerners to seek the wealth of the East and providing the fundamental impetus for the next great age of navigation. Thus, starting from 1500, Western European society gradually developed upwards. By the 17th and 18th centuries, both East and West were again pushing against the limits achievable by agricultural civilization. But this time, the challenges encountered and the opportunities obtained during this peak attempt were completely different for East and West, leading to vastly different fates for both sides over the next few centuries, and also pointing humanity towards a completely new path.

**Intellectual Revolutions and Institutional Innovations in Agricultural Civilization**

In 1798, Thomas Malthus published *An Essay on the Principle of Population*, arguing that population growth would always outstrip humanity's ability to produce food. The subsequent Industrial Revolution made Malthus one of history's most failed prophets. Yet, the "Malthusian Trap" unintentionally became the best historical summary of the agricultural civilization era.

The iron law of agricultural civilization was its bottleneck. Each period of decline and destruction following a civilizational peak attempt tempered the people of the time, making them endure suffering and feel pain. However, pain often also becomes the source of intellectual revolution.

After World War II, the German philosopher Karl Theodor Jaspers, reflecting on the disaster the war brought to Germany and the world, empathetically pointed out that every human disaster has brought about an intellectual revolution. He was the first to identify an axial intellectual revolution around the 5th century BC, naming it the Axial Age. In China in the East, Confucius began to expound his teachings, while a hundred schools of thought contended. In the Middle East, the origin of Western civilization, prophets began recording their thoughts on the world and God in the Old Testament. In India, Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) abandoned his princely life of luxury, began living with beggars, sharing their hardships, and preaching his method for liberation from suffering. In Greece, from Socrates to Plato and Aristotle, great thinkers were comprehensively examining the meaning of the individual, society, and the state.

This intellectual revolution laid an enduring ideological foundation for thousands of years of human development, influencing later generations even today. These thinkers appeared almost simultaneously, from all the civilized centers of the Eurasian world, and the direction of their thoughts was astonishingly consistent. Their common characteristic was that they were all on the margins of their contemporary civilizations, and the problems they pondered were the sufferings of ordinary people, the struggles of marginalized people, and the moans of the lower classes after civilizational collapse. Whether it was Confucius from the State of Lu, Siddhartha Gautama from Kapilavastu, Socrates from Athens, or the displaced prophets of Israel, their common starting point and core concern were the vulnerable groups and the common people. What they collectively opposed were corrupt, brutal, deceitful rulers and bad governments that deceived the people. Therefore, their thoughts were highly revolutionary, yet they themselves were not revolutionaries. Their mission was primarily to explore the ultimate questions of man, society, and the state: What is the meaning of human existence? Why do governments exist? What constitutes a good government and a good society? They also sought the meaning of life, the sublimation of human existence beyond personal life and interests. The benevolence spoken of by Confucius, the Nirvana taught by the Buddha, the God of the Old Testament, the contemplation pursued by Socrates and Greek philosophers—all sought human sublimation and meaning in this world. These thinkers also simultaneously pointed to the golden rule of interpersonal relationships: for example, Confucius's "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire," the Bible's "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," and the Buddha's teaching of compassion for all beings. Based on this core view, the virtuous societies they described were all built upon such interpersonal relationships. A well-governed polity must also be people-oriented, as Confucius and Mencius said, "The people are the most important, the state is less important, and the ruler is the least important." These thinkers were not successful nor widely accepted in their own lifetimes. Socrates was sentenced to death in democratic Athens; Confucius was displaced and his ideas were not accepted throughout his life; the Jews lost their homeland and were displaced for thousands of years; the Buddha did not achieve significant influence during his lifetime. Yet the rich connotation and resilient power of their thoughts transcended their own lives and continue to nourish people's minds today.

The ideas of the first Axial Age were reflected in humanity's first attempt to reach the peak of agricultural civilization. When both East and West almost simultaneously failed in their peak attempts, they subsequently entered dark ages lasting centuries or even a millennium. The pain felt during these times gave rise to the second wave of Axial Age thought. In China, a simplified form of Buddhism spread widely, almost becoming a state religion; in the West, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire and spread rapidly throughout the West; among the desert nomads of the Arabian Peninsula, Islam emerged.

Islam is a very unique phenomenon, being the only religion created by the nomadic peoples themselves, a cultural leap created entirely by the nomads. The founder of Islam, Muhammad, was illiterate, achieved nothing prominent in his youth, and showed no signs of an extraordinary future. But in his forties, he began to regularly see the angel Gabriel in his dreams, conveying messages to him. Initially, Muhammad could not understand his dreams at all. Encouraged by his wife, he began to believe that he had been chosen by God as a mouthpiece, a prophet, and started telling others the words the angel had transmitted to him in his dreams. His words were highly poetic and persuasive, quickly attracting a large following of believers. In the remaining two or three decades of his life, he organized a small nomadic tribe surviving on the edge of the desert, conquering the entire Middle East, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. He and his descendants created the world's third major religion and established the Muslim Empire. In contemporary Chinese terms, this was a standard "underdog reversal." Because nomadic culture started developing later, under Muhammad and his successors, Islam showed sufficient respect, tolerance, and a humble attitude towards learning from all peoples with mature cultures. Western culture, Greek civilization, and Roman civilization were preserved during the Muslim era and transmitted to the East via the grassland highway. Indian spices, Chinese porcelain, and silk also became trade items between East and West through the so-called Silk Road formed by the Muslim-controlled grassland highway.

The focus of the second Axial Age wave was the comfort of the soul, and its manifestations were almost entirely religious. Whether Buddhism, Christianity, or Islam, they all emphasized liberation in the afterlife, comfort for present suffering, and solace for the soul. These two waves of the Axial Age appeared during humanity's transition from low-level to high-level polities, laying the ideological foundation for later high-level polities. The high-level polity in the West was initially represented by the Roman Empire, and in China, it began with the Han Dynasty.

The most important legacy of Axial Age thought was the construction of the political system for high-level government. The Axial Age thought in China directly led to the greatest political institutional innovation in Chinese history—the birth of the imperial examination system. The imperial examination system was the greatest institutional innovation of the entire 2.0 Agricultural Civilization era, and in my opinion, the second greatest institutional innovation in all of human history.

Any empire seeking to address the challenges of agricultural civilization needed peace and development, required trade, as only trade and specialization could optimally allocate resources for agriculture and handicrafts across different regions. Especially under the natural bottlenecks and limited resources of agricultural civilization, optimal resource allocation was even more critical. Therefore, the larger the state, the larger the population, and the more diverse the geography, the stronger its ability to cope with challenges. The transition of human polities from low-level to high-level states was inevitable. But all high-level polities, once established, needed to solve the problem of how to effectively administer the state. Traditionally, political power was based on bloodlines; whoever conquered the realm saw their kinship become the fundamental basis for power distribution. But bloodlines do not guarantee ability, especially not the ability of those holding power after several generations, so such regimes could not endure. Administering a state well requires a meritocratic regime, appointing the capable and virtuous. However, the problem with appointing the capable and virtuous is the inability to guarantee loyalty and political stability. Particularly, capable military leaders holding power would naturally threaten the peace of the regime itself. To cope with the five major challenges of agricultural civilization, humanity had to establish great empires, but the method for effectively managing a vast empire remained a difficult problem until China, building on Axial Age thought, invented an innovative system—the imperial examination system.
