You spend all your time, money, and energy guessing supply and demand relationships and price trends. You start using computers, cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, exhausting all means to guess how prices will change. Before, it might have been guessing annual changes, or changes over two or three years; now you have to guess changes by the minute, two minutes, three minutes, and even study the impact of weather changes on prices!

At this point, the fourth concept of value investing becomes particularly important. This concept, elaborated by Buffett and Munger, is the Circle of Competence. What our industry does is predict the future. And the future itself is inherently unpredictable. You can only arrive at a probability. Some probabilities are high, some are lower. Through long-term persistence and effort, you can research some things very thoroughly, and in predicting the most likely future outcome for a certain company, or the most likely outcome after buying a certain stock at a certain price, you can do better than everyone else. This is your edge. Once you become an expert in a certain area and form a circle of competence, you can act with full confidence. This means that even if everyone else disagrees with you, you are likely correct, because ultimately, the fundamental forces representing company ownership will remain firmly rooted. This goes back to Graham's saying: in the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. The fundamental forces will ultimately prevail.

The most important part of the circle of competence concept is how to define its boundaries. In other words, without boundaries, there is no circle. This means you must know what you don't know. If you don't know what you don't know, you inevitably know nothing about what you claim or think you know. Put another way, if you have an answer to a question, you must have a way to prove under what circumstances this answer would be wrong. When new facts emerge, your answer must still withstand the test.

This is a continuous learning process. Yes, it's difficult, it's not simple at all. But through long-term patience and relentless effort, you can achieve a deep understanding of some things. Your circle of competence will start very small and then gradually expand. A truly great value investor's life is a journey of endless learning. But the benefit is that the knowledge you learn will not be wasted. Different pieces of knowledge accumulate and compound, just like your wealth. In fact, knowledge compounds faster than wealth. For me, this is a wonderful journey and a valuable life. I can guarantee that 26 years later, if I only knew what I knew back then, I wouldn't be standing here giving this speech, and you probably wouldn't want to listen to me.

Now back to an important point. To define your circle of competence, you need Intellectual Honesty. You need to know what you don't know. This is the most important thing. Intellectual honesty can also extend to how you view your work responsibilities and, from a broader perspective, your profession.

Asset management, as a profession, is one of the most difficult because there are too many seemingly plausible theories and methods claiming to make money. Sorry, but many of these are fakes. Asset management is a service industry, just like restaurants or hotels. But the difference is, in most service industries, the customer is the best judge of service quality. If you stay at a hotel, I guarantee you can immediately judge its quality, or if the hotel is average, you can immediately judge whether the price charged is reasonable or outrageous. If you go to a restaurant, you don't even need to pick up your chopsticks; a sniff tells you if the food is good or bad. If you go to a dry cleaner, etc., the examples are countless. In most service industries, the customer is the best judge; the recipient of the service is the best judge of its quality.

But the asset management industry is not like this. For most people, if someone comes to sell you money management services, judging whether this person is good or bad is extremely difficult. The seller can cite their performance from last month, last year, or the past five years as evidence. But you still can't tell, because many things affect performance. You can never be sure if good performance is due to luck or skill. You need to see a sufficiently long-term track record, and you need to know how the manager achieved it. If this person is a stock-picker, before you judge them as a good investor, you need to understand a few of the stocks they picked to truly understand their investment process. This is very difficult to do, and not everyone is suited for it. This creates huge room for "fuzzy accounting." That's why if you think carefully about the vast majority of so-called "theories," they are essentially "the tail wagging the dog." The logic behind it is very simple – if it benefits me, it must benefit the client. This is also why this profession is highly paid. Any industry related to "fuzzy accounting" always has high salaries.

I always say, if you are truly honest with yourself, then imagine every dollar you receive from a client as coming from your parents, who are middle-class, have worked hard all their lives, spent almost all their money on your education to send you to Harvard, leaving only this little bit of money left. Now you've graduated from Harvard Business School, and they entrust their money to you, feeling that you can help them grow their wealth a little. What would you do? I don't think you would lose their money through trading. You would have a different understanding of the concept of Fiduciary Duty. You would be more focused on what you do.

You would think fundamentally about where every dollar is spent, how it supports the basic aspects of social and economic life. You would look for a win-win situation. You would spend a long time patiently researching things until you are sure you can predict the state of a company many years later with high probability, especially when the stock price falls. If you won't suffer a permanent loss when the stock price falls, then making money when the price rises comes naturally. You won't complain that the market is too crazy, complain about Mr. Market and everyone's neuroticism. No. You will only say, I don't understand. You can comfortably say I don't understand. I only understand a small part; the rest is outside my circle of competence. As long as I truly understand what's within my circle of competence, it's okay that I know nothing about what's outside it.

By the way, to be successful, you don't need that many things in your circle of competence, really you don't. As Warren and Charlie said, in their five or six-decade careers, if you remove their 15 most successful ideas, their performance would become mediocre. Berkshire Hathaway's market cap grew from ten or twenty million dollars, without issuing any significant new shares, to $500 billion now. Those 15 ideas really made a fortune!

Look at me. I started with negative net worth, and now I can say I've done quite well, enough to be secure. Similarly, my success probably came from no more than 10 ideas in 26 years. So you really don't need that many ideas. But, the ideas that lead to investment actions must be ones you truly understand. Most of the time, you don't need to invest; this is the true meaning of intellectual honesty. Those who can do this have a natural trait that allows them to be comfortable outside the mainstream, outside public opinion, able to ignore the views of the crowd. This ignorance isn't saying others are too crazy, but saying "I don't understand."

It's okay to say you don't understand. Actually, it's dangerous to say that data can predict any security transaction. What is data? Data is a record of what happened in the past. Quantitative trading, AI trading claim data is omnipotent, equivalent to saying past events can infallibly predict the future. Has that ever happened? I don't

think so. But importantly, if you spend so much time understanding some things, focusing on studying them, then over time your accuracy in predicting these things will improve. Investing when there is a high probability of success and the downside risk is minimal, then no matter how the market changes, you can safely achieve good returns. This is what most successful value investors, or fundamental investors, whatever you call them, have always been doing. Unfortunately, these people are a very small minority. But this small minority is important because they represent the original reason the market exists. If the market didn't exist for this reason, then the market would just be an amplified casino. I don't think our society needs such a large casino. What do you think? In real life, we spend so much on transaction costs just for buying and selling. If you trade short-term to win money, you're basically playing a zero-sum game, winning or losing among a fixed group of people. What benefit does it have for society, for an advanced civilization like humanity? I don't know. It's a good question.

But if you are a fundamental investor, you support a company worth supporting, a company you understand, you can safely predict that this company will become better and grow larger over time, its value will increase, and you will get a return proportional to your share of the investment. That's fantastic! It gives you a sense of achievement. What you do benefits society, benefits your parents, and benefits yourself.

This concludes my "sermon" on fundamental investing (value investment) for today! Thank you!

**The Future of the Chinese Economy from a Foreign Investor's Perspective**
— Keynote Speech at an International Investors Conference, January 2019

Today I want to talk about a topic we usually don't discuss. We are bottom-up investors, primarily focused on companies, valuations, businesses, and industries. But in the past few years, especially last year, many people have been deeply worried about China's macro environment, with pessimism spreading. I guess that's also why some of you have come here from afar. So today we'll make an exception and talk about the macro environment. Ultimately, when we invest in a company in a country, in a sense, we are also investing in that country. We need a general understanding of this country.

Another point to note is that as investors, we focus on predictions about the future that are most likely correct. Our analysis strives to be objective and rational, free from biases brought by any ideology or emotion. We want to describe "reality," not "ideals" or "hopes."

Below is the outline of my speech today, divided into five parts:
I. Historical and cultural differences between China and the West;
II. China's modernization journey and the economic miracle of the past forty years;
III. The current pessimism among investors, especially overseas investors, towards China;
IV. The three different stages of economic development: the positions of China and the West today;
V. The growth potential of the Chinese economy.

First, we will discuss the differences between China and the West, their respective unique characteristics, and what causes these differences and uniqueness. Most Westerners view China through a Western lens, while most Chinese view other countries through a Chinese lens. This difference leads to much confusion and misunderstanding. If you don't understand the historical differences between China and the West and the roots of these differences, you cannot truly understand them deeply or make predictions about their development. In the second part, we will briefly describe China's modernization journey and explain the economic miracle of the past forty years, namely the ultra-long period of super-high economic growth. In the third part, we will discuss the current political and economic environment in China that investors are generally concerned about, what characterizes the current era, and what it means. In the fourth part, we will discuss the three different stages of economic development. Finally, based on these discussions, we can estimate the growth prospects of the Chinese economy over the next 5, 10, or even 20 years.

I know this is a very ambitious agenda, covering quite a few areas. Sorry, due to time constraints, I can only go through it quickly. This rushed approach is contrary to our usual way of working. My goal is to provide a general framework to help you begin to understand these issues. Most of today's discussion is the product of my thinking over the past 40 years. Since my youth, I have been obsessed with thinking about some of these questions. If you want more in-depth discussion, I can provide more reference materials.

**I. Historical and Cultural Differences between China and the West**

First, let's discuss what exactly caused the differences and unique characteristics of China and the West. From ancient societies until modern times, China and the West, or simply put, East and West, were separated by the Himalayas and the vast Mongolian grasslands into two blocks, with almost no exchange. Thus, Eastern and Western civilizations developed independently. Some chance historical events led the East and West onto different paths at different times, so they also developed different tendencies in their approaches to things and the systems they established. Of course, Chinese and Westerners are both human, sharing common human traits. But they developed differently because human nature manifested different aspects under the influence of different external factors. I will talk about some basic events that led to these differences, with the geographical environment being the most important reason.

First, look at China's geographical environment. To the west of China is the roof of the world, the Himalayas, an almost insurmountable barrier for humans. To the north are the vast, cold Mongolian grasslands. To the east and south is the sea. Very interestingly, two great rivers, both originating in the Himalayas, the Yangtze and the Yellow River, flow in the same direction into the sea. Before humans discovered the Americas, the alluvial plain formed between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers was one of the most fertile, vast, and suitable lands for agriculture on Earth, a land bestowed by heaven. Therefore, agriculture sprouted very early here. These two great rivers, plus some tributaries, provided an economical and convenient means of transportation between various regions on the plain. So, as long as one place could gather sufficient power, conquering this entire land was not difficult.

The foundation of agricultural civilization is photosynthesis, which converts solar energy into crops and...
