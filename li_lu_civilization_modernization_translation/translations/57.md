By interpreting the distinct elegance of the two civilizations, I can hear the grand melody in silence and perceive form in the formless. This unique trait allows me to navigate seamlessly between Chinese and American cultures. I now believe more firmly that 1+1 can equal 11. Therefore, I consider the exchange and communication between China and the United States, and between our two peoples, as my personal responsibility – to interpret each other's stories for one another. This endeavor will also be one of the primary missions for the latter half of my life.

Thank heavens! I have three daughters. They are lively, lovely, intelligent, and kind-hearted. I am immensely proud of them. Because I love them so deeply, I do not wish for excessive inheritance to hinder their life's freedom. I will encourage them, along with my wife Eva and me, to dedicate ourselves through our family philanthropic foundation to creating a better world. Leveraging their innate cross-cultural advantages, I hope they will join me in working to enhance mutual understanding between China and the United States, especially among the general public. Furthermore, the high-quality education I received both in China and at Columbia University is the most crucial factor in my achievements today. My colleagues and I will continue to promote the education and practice of value investing. I also hope to have the opportunity to strive for enabling more young people to receive a high-quality, borderless education like I did. This is a direction my family, colleagues, and I will work towards in the future.

Fifty years old marks a watershed moment for me. From this day on, I am likely closer to the end than the beginning. Regarding perspectives on age, I admire Norman Lear's enlightened outlook. Norman is 94 this year and still thriving in many fields. In the US, his fans range from those in their eighties and nineties down to those in their twenties and thirties. Once I asked Norman, "How old do you feel?" He replied, "I am always the same age as the person I am talking to." That is the coolest answer about age I have ever heard! Since then, I have paid special attention to the people I converse with. Starting today, I am officially past half a century. I urgently need and sincerely invite young friends to walk alongside me; you will help me stay current and keep me young at heart.

My dear friends! I wish us all that with the passing years, we gain not just age but also wisdom; may spring fill the universe and joy overflow at our doors!

**Afterword**

Too many people deserve thanks for bringing this book to publication, but undoubtedly, my foremost gratitude goes to my wife, Eva. She not only participated extensively in the early stages of the manuscript work, serving as the first reader for many of my drafts and offering invaluable suggestions, but also provided the most generous understanding and warmest support during the period I spent writing day and night, sacrificing immensely for our family. To have such a beloved, partner, friend, and kindred spirit, I am truly fortunate.

My profound thanks to my dear friends, Mr. Chang Jin and Ms. Liu Liu. Had it not been for their years of persistent insistence and constant "pestering," I would never have had the inclination to commit these thoughts of mine to writing. From walks and heart-to-heart talks in the Pasadena City Hall gardens, to sharing at friend gatherings and salons, to recordings on a voice recorder, and finally to words on paper – Mr. Chang Jin has already eloquently detailed the book's formation process in his preface, so I won't elaborate further. In short, during the process of organizing thoughts into articles and compiling articles into a collection, friends like Chang Jin, Liu Liu, Shi Hongjun, and others are all people I must thank. It is no exaggeration to say that without them, this book would not exist. Additionally, I would like to thank Ms. Li Min, founder of Huxiu.com, for first publishing my modernization series articles on Huxiu.com; thank Mr. Shi Hongjun of CITIC Press Group for his enthusiastic encouragement and invitations over the years to publish this book; and thank Editor Guo Jiayang for her extensive concrete work on this book throughout the process.

Since the modernization series articles were released in 2014, I have received enthusiastic responses and valuable suggestions from many friends, many of which have been enlightening and helpful to me, for which I express my gratitude. My colleagues at Himalaya Capital were the first readers of many of my articles, providing insightful feedback and suggestions. I am deeply thankful to them and also immensely proud of these talented colleagues. In particular, I must give special thanks to my assistant, Ms. Zheng Jing, who dedicated tremendous effort to the manuscripts for this book and enhanced it considerably with her meticulous thinking and exceptional writing skills. In the earliest stages of text organization, Ms. Liu Shuang also invested significant energy and time, for which I also extend my thanks.

Since my youth, reading has been my greatest joy. Reading allows me to travel freely across different times and spaces, to converse and commune spiritually with the sages and wise thinkers of all eras throughout history. Many ideas in this book emerged from the collision of thoughts with these ancient philosophers and contemporary intellectuals. Although we have never met, in my heart, I regard them as dear friends and comrades; I am grateful for the inspiration and insights they have provided me over the years. In my view, this is the greatest joy and benefit of reading.

In the real world, Mr. Charlie Munger is widely revered and considered by the world to be among these ancient sages and contemporary wise men. And how fate has favored me, allowing me to become genuine close friends despite the age difference with him over the past decade and more, developing a profound bond that is both mentor-mentee and deep friendship. Through countless conversations with Mr. Munger, I have gained much enlightenment. Many ideas in this book concerning civilization, modernization, and value investing are inseparable from our extensive exchanges and the mutual penetration of our thoughts. Often, a person's greatest limitation is the inability to see their own blind spots. Through sustained effort, one can achieve objectivity and rationality on many issues, but it is hardest to do so regarding oneself. True friends and mentors are those who can point out the blind spots on you. The greatest help Mr. Munger has given me is helping me recognize my own biggest blind spot. If not for him, I might still be cocooning myself, drawing a circle around myself and confining myself within it. For this, I am eternally grateful to him.

Finally, I wish to say that the domains covered in this book are broad, and many fall outside my professional expertise; this book is not an academic monograph. If measured by the standards of an academic monograph, its rigor and accuracy may be lacking, and the materials used for citations and arguments are far from sufficiently detailed and comprehensive. I hope for the understanding of all experts, scholars, and readers. My original intention was to offer interested readers some different perspectives. If it provides some inspiration to everyone, I will be very gratified and satisfied.
