Why can the combination of modern technology and the free market economy enable the human economy to enter a state of sustainable compound growth? Li Lu used the theory of comparative advantage, developed by the classical economics master, the British political economist David Ricardo, to explain: two individuals with different capabilities, if they each focus on their specialties, the total value they create after exchanging with each other is actually greater. This can be represented by the mathematical formula 1+1>2. The more people involved in exchange, the larger the market, and the greater the incremental value created. Li Lu further pointed out that this illustrates the free market itself is an economy of scale.

The conclusion that "the free market economy can create more social wealth" is no longer a remarkable insight today. The father of modern economics, Adam Smith, had already systematically revealed the secret that the division of labor plus free exchange creates more social wealth in his *The Wealth of Nations*. David Ricardo, in his *On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation*, further developed the theory of comparative advantage based on Adam Smith's work, explaining why free trade between nations creates more social wealth and benefits both parties. However, 1+1>2 cannot fully explain the phenomenon of long-term compound growth in the modern economy. Because when everyone participates in the free exchange market and the division of labor is maximized, the growth of social wealth reaches its limit. Li Lu made a breakthrough on this issue by pointing out the amplifying effect of human knowledge accumulation on the incremental gains from social division of labor and exchange. He used the mathematical formula 1+1>4 to express this: "When different ideas are exchanged, both parties not only retain their own ideas and acquire the other's ideas, but also spark new ideas through the interaction. It is precisely because of this characteristic of human knowledge accumulation that modern science and technology continuously progress and innovate. When modern technology combines with the free market, the increase in efficiency, the increment of wealth, and the economies of scale are all magnified manifold. This perfectly combines with humanity's unlimited needs, forming the modern economy characterized by continuous compound growth."

The British science writer Matt Ridley, in his book *The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves*, proposed the thesis that the exchange of ideas leads to innovation, famously expressing it with the metaphor "ideas having sex with each other." Li Lu elevated Ridley's concept to a theoretical height, using the 1+1>4 formula to simply and clearly express the reason for the exponential growth of human knowledge, and used it to explain why, under the combination of modern technology and the free market economy, the modern economy exhibits the characteristic of sustained exponential growth.

The most insightful aspect of Li Lu's thought is his recognition of the inherent economies of scale in the free market economy itself and the amplifying effect of modern technology on these scale economies, from which he deduced the Iron Law of Civilization 3.0. He pointed out in his writings that a free competitive market is a mechanism that continuously self-evolves, self-improves, and self-perfects. The intervention of modern technology makes this process exceptionally rapid. Thus, among different competing markets, the largest market will ultimately become the only market. Any person, society, enterprise, or country that leaves this largest market will continually fall behind and eventually be forced to join. He further pointed out that globalization is the inevitable result of the Iron Law of Civilization 3.0. After globalization, goods, services, technology, and financial markets are further integrated, expanded, and deepened worldwide, making the cost of leaving this market increasingly high.

The famous journalist Thomas L. Friedman, in his book *The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century*, described the rapid development of the wave of globalization worldwide and attempted to explore its deep-seated reasons, but he raised more questions than he answered. Of course, the author's intention might not have been to solve why globalization occurs. The Iron Law of Civilization 3.0 proposed by Li Lu resolved a long-standing intellectual dilemma I had after reading that book, providing a reasonable explanation for the root cause of globalization.

In the six chapters from Lecture 12 to 16 in the first part, applying his theoretical framework of human civilizational progress and modernization, as well as his deep understanding of Chinese culture and East-West cultural differences, Li Lu made predictions about China's economic, cultural, and political development over the coming decades, discussing the course and prospects of China's modernization, Sino-Western relations in the era of Civilization 3.0, and the common destiny of humanity's future.

In the discussion on Chinese culture, he proposed adding a "Sixth Relationship" to the traditional Chinese Five Relationships to define the relationship between strangers, using honesty as the moral principle for this "Sixth Relationship." In discussing Sino-US relations, he believed that geographical location played a significant role in the formation of cultural differences during the development of Eastern and Western civilizations. The uniqueness of its geographical location led China to develop large empires and invent the "Political Meritocracy" earliest. Similarly, due to geography, the West invented the "Economic Meritocracy" earliest and entered modern technological civilization first. Due to their different geographical locations, the West and China formed their own unique cultural and civilizational traditions, which also led to some inherent biases when interpreting each other. Understanding this is extremely important for comprehending the similarities and differences in the modernization processes of China and the West. For a long time, I personally had some困惑 regarding how China modernizes. The concepts of "Political Meritocracy" and "Economic Meritocracy" summarized by Li Lu suddenly enlightened me, giving me a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences in the modernization processes of China and the West.

Regarding the course and prospects of China's modernization, Li Lu believes that China took many detours over the past hundred-plus years. Only when China truly achieved the combination of a market economy and science & technology, under relatively peaceful domestic and international circumstances, did modernization begin to occur on a large scale in China. Based on his theoretical framework, he predicts that under the same conditions, modernization will further develop in China in the coming decades. Unlike the era of Civilization 2.0, in the era of Civilization 3.0, the world's ruling order has transitioned from territorial occupation to dominance primarily through control of the world market. Because of the Iron Law of Civilization 3.0, the largest market will eventually become the only market. Recognizing this characteristic of the era is particularly important for China's choices within the current world order.

I believe that Li Lu's understanding of the essence of modernization and his exposition on the Iron Law of Civilization 3.0 can not only theoretically dispel various myths about modernization for ordinary readers like me but also provide valuable reference for scholars in various fields related to the development of human civilization, such as society, politics, economy, and culture. Once Li Lu's Iron Law of Civilization 3.0 is widely demonstrated and accepted, it will fundamentally impact people's re-understanding and comprehension of modern civilization and their outlook on the future course of human civilization.

The second part of the book, "Value Investing and Rational Thinking," is divided into two sections. The "Value Investing and China" section includes Li Lu's articles and speeches on value investing. The most important three are his thoughts and arguments on the connotation of value investing and its practice in China. These texts record Li Lu's thoughts, understanding, and insights on the basic ideas of value investing, the relationship between value investing and the modern economy, the feasibility of value investing in China, as well as his life experiences and reflections during his investment career.

Within the edifice of value investing thought, Li Lu has contributed his understanding, insights, and practical experience. His论证 for the rationality of value investing lays a new cornerstone for the theory of value investing. By combining his unique interpretation and theory of human civilizational progress and modernization with China's cultural and historical characteristics, and applying them to the practice of value investing, he has created a unique landscape within this grand intellectual structure.

The second section, "Reading, Thinking, and Reflections," mainly collects one book review and four reflective essays by Li Lu, discussing human nature and financial crises, financial regulation, the circle of competence, intellectual honesty, and sharing his understanding of Charlie Munger's ideas, as well as reflections on future technology, the era, and life.

Like Mr. Munger, Li Lu also has a deep understanding of human nature. His several brushes with death have given him a profound understanding of human nature. An innate independence and nonconformity hidden deep in his genes since youth made Li Lu incompatible with all existing realities, prejudices, and authorities when he was young, often leading to suppression and slander from others. All these fueled a great curiosity in him about human nature and behavior, which in my view sometimes reached the point of "being overly meticulous." Even for commonplace matters, he would ask why, and always managed to find deeper reasons, which compelled me to admire his insight. For example, he proposed the view that the market's existence is a test and punishment of human nature, something I would never have thought of.

Value investing is a niche field where many talk about it but few truly practice it. Li Lu is one of the very few in this field who possesses a deep understanding and insight into value investing and has demonstrated outstanding performance in practice. Due to his humility and low profile, Li Lu rarely appears in public media, so his professional achievements are often overlooked. In fact, judging by his over twenty-year investment track record and the scale of assets he personally manages, he is one of the top-tier investors globally. His investment success is not only due to the teachings of masters like Munger, Buffett, and Graham, nor solely due to extensive reading, study, and thinking, but also greatly benefited from his own cultivation and character.

Due to work relations, I was fortunate to learn a lot about the theory and ideas of value investing from Li Lu, receiving his guidance and refinement during research, and his trust and supervision at work. I grew from a layman in value investing to a professional, even representing him on the podium of top universities, enjoying the satisfaction of students calling me "teacher." But knowledge and skills were not the most valuable gains I received from Li Lu; his values, attitude towards life, and way of thinking are what I cherish most. In terms of understanding "Fiduciary Duty," I have never met anyone more serious and rigorous than Li Lu. For him, fiduciary duty is the lifeline of our investment career, the moral bottom line of our conduct, which cannot be crossed under any excuse. Every single thing in our work must take this as the starting point. Fiduciary duty forms the cornerstone of the core values and culture of Himalaya Capital.

Li Lu possesses another character trait: Intellectual Honesty. This is not only something he often speaks about, but the standard to which he adheres is also among the highest I have ever seen in my life. Laziness in learning and thinking is part of human nature. We often stop thinking about what we don't know because we think we know something, often pretending to know what we don't, and rarely test what we know for errors. This is a major obstacle preventing deeper research work. Li Lu's requirement for intellectual honesty, by ordinary standards, is very stringent. He absolutely forbids pretending to understand what one doesn't and even has a natural, instinctive aversion to it. Due to my past professional experience and flaws in my thinking habits, I often took things for granted or pretended to understand, and each time he pinpointed it incisively. At first, I thought he was nitpicking, but later I gradually gained a more objective and in-depth understanding of my own flaws and blind spots, and a deeper comprehension of intellectual honesty. With his help, I gradually established good thinking habits and came to appreciate more profoundly the importance of intellectual honesty in our learning, work, and life.

I used to wonder: although there are few people in the investment world with his level of intellectual power and insight, there are countless people smarter and with better conditions than him. Why did he stand out, achieve such success, and remain undefeated in the market's cruel test of human nature? Later I gradually understood it's the difference between technique and the Dao. Most people learn techniques, but those who seek the Dao are extremely rare. Li Lu is one who has attained the Dao. Because he attained the Dao, he receives abundant support. In the stormy seas of market fluctuations, one needs not only high skill but also a group of investors who truly trust and support you. Their long-term trust is not only because of your good performance and persuasive methods, but more importantly, because your professional integrity is flawless, and everything you do is completely aligned with the interests of your investors. In Li Lu's career, most of his earliest investors are still his investors today; not a single penny has been withdrawn in the past 21 years. This level of trust I had only heard of in stories about Buffett and Munger. This is precisely what Mr. Munger called "a seamless web of deserved trust."

Doing one thing and persisting for a short while is not difficult, but persisting consistently for over twenty years is almost impossible for ordinary people. The reason Li Lu can do it is that he has perfectly integrated the professional requirements of value investing with his life values, worldview, and ideal pursuits, reaching the realm of the Dao, just like Buffett and Mr. Munger.

I remember when I first joined Himalaya Capital, Li Lu recommended several books to me, one of which was the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Later, he also recommended *Benjamin Franklin: An American Life* by Walter Isaacson. It wasn't until I read *Poor Charlie's Almanack* that I learned Mr. Munger also regarded Benjamin Franklin as a life model. Franklin was a polymath; his life, driven by the pursuit of true knowledge, was full of wisdom and creative thought, setting a supreme beacon for future generations. Like Franklin and Mr. Munger, Li Lu also considers the pursuit of true knowledge his lifelong passion and career. His articles, speeches, and reflections are filled with ideas that excite and inspire me.
