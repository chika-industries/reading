**XIII. Advice for Investment Beginners**

**Q: Could you give some advice to students who want to go into investment management?**

You must learn from the best: listen, study, read. But the best way to understand investment is through practice; there's no better way. The best way to practice is to pick a company and research it thoroughly as if you were going to invest, even if you don't actually put money in. The process of thoroughly researching a company from the perspective of assuming you own 100% of its equity is extremely valuable.
As a beginner, you can choose a company that is easy to understand. It can be a very small company, like a local convenience store, a restaurant, or a small listed company; it doesn't matter. Try to understand a company, figure out how it operates: how it makes a profit, how its financial structure is organized, how management makes decisions, how it compares to competitors in the same industry, how it adapts to the broader environment, how it invests surplus cash, how it raises capital, etc.
If you owned 100% of a company, even if you weren't the operator, you would do your utmost to understand every aspect of the company to protect your investment. This way, you'll know how to invest well. This is how you truly understand business and investment. Buffett often says that to be a good investor, you must first be a good businessperson; to be a good businessperson, you must also be a good investor in allocating your capital.
Starting by choosing a company within your circle of competence and researching it thoroughly is an excellent starting point for beginners. If you can start from this foundation, you are on the right path to becoming an excellent securities analyst.

**Investment, Speculation, and the Stock Market**
— Keynote Speech at the Harvard Business School Investment Conference, March 2018

Thank you very much to the conference organizers for their outstanding work on today's event. I heard many interesting things from the other speakers this morning, as well as some strange ideas. I'm very happy to be here on the Harvard Business School campus.
This occasion reminds me of my early career experiences. About 30 years ago, I came to the US from China, had just started at Columbia University, could barely speak English, and was stunned by the huge student loans. So, I started asking my classmates for advice on how to make a living in this country. One day, a classmate handed me a flyer, saying this lecture was about how to make money, and I should go. I had been to other lectures before, some of which offered free food. I saw the flyer said this lecture would also provide food, so I decided to go.

I went and found the classroom was about the size of this one. I was surprised it was so large, but when I looked around, there was no food! I asked someone where the buffet was? Later, I discovered it was the person standing at the podium; his name was Buffett. You see, back then I couldn't tell the difference between one 'T' and two 'T's!
"Since I was already here, I might as well stay," so I decided to stay and listen to what this person had to say that was better than free food. I stayed, and Warren Buffett talked about the basic concepts of value investing. Somehow, what he said was like an epiphany for me. That lecture changed my life. After that, I spent a whole year studying Buffett, Munger, and Berkshire Hathaway, and then bought my first stock with borrowed money. For the past 25 or 26 years, I've never thought about changing careers.
Therefore, I thought today I should perhaps say something helpful to the students, especially to respond to some of this morning's speakers who claimed that the future of the market is quantitative trading and that fundamental investing is unnecessary.
Since we discussed many basic issues this morning, I think I should also spend a little time discussing the market from the most fundamental perspective. What is the stock market? It is a mechanism that pools the funds of small savers to invest in businesses. Its design means it slowly becomes a wonderful, self-reinforcing win-win mechanism – if businesses are profitable, then the small savers, who are also employees, shareholders, and consumers, benefit. As employees, their wages increase, their savings increase. As savers become wealthier, they consume more products from businesses and invest more funds into businesses, which then grow. If this happens on a large scale, it is fundamentally beneficial to society. This is the original purpose of the stock market.
Of course, the biggest problem is that the vast majority of small savers don't know how to price stocks. Stocks can depreciate with business failures, so investing in the stock market is inherently risky for small savers. In a sense, a "tipping point" needs to be reached for this self-reinforcing win-win mechanism to occur. Most savers (if not all) and most businesses (if not all) need to participate in this system of exchange for it to work effectively. This is the history of stock market development.

How does this process happen specifically? All stock markets, when they begin, have this characteristic: they allow people to sell shares (contracts for partial ownership of a business) anytime after purchase. This characteristic directly caters to a fundamental aspect of human nature. No matter how we humans portray ourselves, our nature includes laziness, greed, and speculation. If there's a way to get more than what we paid for, we will do it; if there's a way to get more with less time, we will do it. The tradable nature of the stock market fits perfectly with the laziness, greed, and speculation in human nature. This is key to the formation of the market mechanism. More and more people are attracted to the stock market. As more people enter, more businesses enter, creating a positive feedback loop.
Stock markets everywhere start off full of bubbles, speculation, trading, gaming, and volatility. You can't help but wonder why such a crazy thing ultimately withstands the test of time? Because it has a fundamental element – there are some genuine savers who want to invest in growing businesses; and there are some genuinely good businesses that need capital to develop. Once the number of these savers and businesses reaches a critical point, the market as a whole becomes more efficient. This is what we observe.
From the beginning, the stock market has two basic forces (elements). One element is investment, which is supporting the right businesses with capital at the right price; the other element is speculative gambling, making quick money easily through short-term trading. It is this speculative element that attracts more and more people to participate in the stock market. The supply and demand from everyone's buying and selling determine the stock's trading price. Over time, the force of short-term trading becomes increasingly powerful. So, which type of person is more numerous in the market? You guessed it: speculators. So much so that some even claim the market doesn't need the first force (investment) at all, and we should just let machines trade!

Is that really true? I don't think so. If it were, consider something similar: a casino. The reason casinos cannot exist on a large scale is that they do not provide any fundamental utility to society. The primary task of the market's existence is to provide a very useful function for society. If you always keep this in mind, you know that fundamental investors will always have their role. It's just that this fundamental investing force in the market is relatively small. According to estimates by Professor Louis Lowenstein of Columbia Law School, these investors might only account for about 5% of all market participants. The market is dominated by those who love to trade. Even some who claim to be fundamental investors say their investment strategies must adapt to the market. This mindset quickly shifts them to the other camp, where they become extremely focused on what's happening in the market. Their judgment is influenced by market fluctuations, sometimes by annual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly performance, sometimes even to the minute-by-minute level. This is the market behavior we see today.
Of course, you could also say these behaviors are supported by Nobel Prize-winning theories, like the market is always efficient, supply and demand are driven by rational people, and so on. But think about the absurdities you heard this morning – in the most successful quantitative trading hedge funds, employing thousands of PhDs in math and physics, not a single one knows how to read a financial statement!
See, this is the so-called efficient market theory. In fact, in the short term, stock prices often behave exactly opposite to the laws of commodity prices in classical economics. For example, in classical economics, when commodity prices rise, people buy less; when there's a sale, more people buy. But in the stock market, when stock prices rise, people buy more, and the faster they rise, the more people buy; when stock prices fall, people sell, and the worse the bear market, the more they sell.
In my 26 years in the investment industry, I have never seen the market be completely efficient in pricing the stocks of companies I know something about. Despite all the turbulence, I believe the market's ultimate evolutionary direction is still determined by that fundamental force that initially prompted its formation. This is because, although fundamental investors and the funds they manage are almost always a minority in the market, they are the ultimate determiners of asset prices. The stock market is a weighing machine in the long run, and the price discovery mechanism of the stock market is achieved through fundamental value investors. It's just that this process takes a long time. Only through fundamental value investors does the market have a price discovery mechanism over the long term.
Furthermore, only a market with a reasonable price discovery mechanism can continue to develop and grow. When the market grows beyond a critical point, and listed companies represent all the sizable companies in the economy, then index fund investing becomes possible. Because in a modern economy, the economy can achieve compound growth over centuries, for a stock market beyond the critical point, the returns of an index fund represent the average return on equity investment in the economy, and in the long run, will show a trend of compound growth like the economy itself. So, although index funds seem like just machine trading, their existence presupposes the existence of fundamental investors. Without them, the market would have no economic reason to exist, couldn't reach scale, and index investing wouldn't be effective in the long run.

Thus, we see that fundamental investors, although scarce in the market, play a significant role. So what are the elements of fundamental investing, which we call value investing? It has only four basic concepts. The first three were articulated by Benjamin Graham over a hundred years ago, and the last concept was articulated and exemplified by Buffett, Munger, and Berkshire Hathaway.

1. First, a stock is a piece of paper you can trade, but this paper also represents your ownership of the company; owning a stock means owning a part of the business.
2. Second, the stock represents the company, so the company's performance will determine the stock's value.
3. Third, the future is hard to predict, so you need a margin of safety. As Seth Klarman discussed this morning, his entire investment philosophy, methods, and experience illustrate the importance of a margin of safety better than most others.
Then we need a theory describing the behavior of most participants in the market. It's called Mr. Market. You can think of the entire market as an energetic fellow who wakes up every morning and shouts prices at you casually. Most of the time, you can simply ignore him. Sometimes this guy becomes very crazy, with a neurotic emotional fluctuation, and then he throws an absurd price at you, which you can either buy or sell at. This is a great opportunity you can exploit.

These are the three basic concepts of value investing articulated by Benjamin Graham. Then the problem arises: in the real world, you find that Mr. Market is real people, perhaps people sitting in this classroom, your classmates, even today's panelists and speakers. They don't look like lunatics; some have PhDs in math, they have this or that honor, they are very smart people. At this point, most people doubt themselves: Are these people really Mr. Market? Is it possible that 99% of people are wrong and only I am right?
Then you think again, these people also have the Nobel Prize-winning efficient market theory backing them up. More importantly, another aspect of human nature kicks in: our herd mentality. If enough people we respect, know, whose character and moral principles we admire, are all thinking the same way, all worrying about changes in supply and demand, suddenly we start questioning ourselves. Do I really understand? Maybe they are correct; the daily market movements are indeed important. Perhaps we should also join this game of guessing supply and demand changes and price movements. Maybe that should be our focus.
This is why, no matter how many good ideas you start with, as the years of your career increase, you lose half of those ideas and join this huge trading force. You spend all your time, money, and energy guessing supply, demand, and price movements. You start using computers, cutting-edge technology, AI, big data, exhausting all means to guess how prices will move. Before, it might have been guessing annual, biennial, or triennial changes; now it's guessing minute-by-minute, and even studying how weather changes affect prices!

At this point, the fourth concept of value investing becomes particularly important. This concept, articulated by Buffett and Munger, is the circle of competence. What our industry needs to do is predict the future.
