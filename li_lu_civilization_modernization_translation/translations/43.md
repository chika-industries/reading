The Himalayan mountains and the vast Mongolian grasslands divided the world into two regions, with little interaction between them. Thus, Eastern and Western civilizations developed independently. A series of historical accidents pushed East and West onto different paths at different times, leading them to build systems and adopt approaches that reflected different tendencies. Of course, both Chinese and Westerners are human, with common traits of humanity. But external conditions shaped different directions of development, highlighting different aspects of human nature. I will describe some fundamental events behind these divergences, with geography being the most important factor.

Let’s begin with China’s geography. To the west lies the “roof of the world,” the Himalayas—an almost insurmountable barrier. To the north lies the vast, frigid Mongolian steppe, while the east and south face the sea. Interestingly, two great rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow River, both spring from the Himalayas and flow in the same direction into the sea. Before the discovery of the Americas, the alluvial plain between these rivers was one of the most fertile and expansive farmlands on Earth—a true gift of nature. Agriculture thus sprouted very early here. The rivers and their tributaries also provided cheap and efficient transportation across the plain. Once any group amassed enough strength, conquering the whole region was not difficult.

Agricultural civilization rests on photosynthesis, which transforms sunlight into crops and livestock, all dependent on land. This meant the size of arable land determined agricultural output and thus the population it could sustain. Scarcity of land was a recurring theme throughout agricultural history. More land meant more people, but once population exceeded what land could support, societies fell into the Malthusian trap: war, plague, and famine would slash numbers, and the cycle would begin anew. Agricultural economies were shortage economies—land set a ceiling on sustainable population. Population decline often played out along ethnic, tribal, or national lines: the group holding the most land survived, while others perished. Wars in agricultural societies were usually about land.

In 5,000 years of Chinese history, countless such wars occurred. The ultimate victors were societies that invented methods of mobilizing people on a massive scale—those with well-developed political systems. Humanity is unique: highly individual yet highly social. The Chinese were the first to explore methods of large-scale mobilization. About 2,400 years ago, the small western state of Qin launched the Shang Yang reforms, a revolutionary innovation in social organization. Before this, political power everywhere was based on bloodlines, just as humans had extended kinship ties since evolving from animals. Qin broke this pattern. Property could be inherited, but political power could not. Power was distributed based on merit and ability within a single generation.

Until then, both China and the West (well into modern times) ran feudal systems where political titles were hereditary, ossifying society. The Shang Yang reforms created a merit-based system: selection of talent and political appointments depended on knowledge, ability, and achievement, but not birth. This gave everyone a path upward, mobilizing the energies of all. Qin, though small, unified all of China, founding a vast empire. For two millennia afterward, Chinese dynasties organized society in similar ways. Thus, in the agricultural age, China was consistently strong, with a highly refined political system. The Chinese first invented a merit-based bureaucracy—Political Meritocracy—that still endures in some form today, attracting the best and brightest into government. The West never had such a tradition.

Turning to the West, particularly Europe, whose role in modern history is central. Europe’s geography was fragmented: small rivers flowing in all directions, mountains dividing the land into defensible pieces, and thick forests until late in history. During the Roman Empire, much of Europe remained barbaric. Only after Rome’s fall, as forests were cleared, did agriculture grow. But Europe’s land could never support a single unified empire. Attempts at reunification all failed. Small kingdoms could be ruled through kinship and aristocratic ties alone. Political power remained hereditary. Thus, before modern times, Western politics never developed toward equality and meritocracy as in China.

Yet Europe had a decisive geographical advantage, crucial in the past 500 years. Compare distances to the Americas: Europe is about 3,000 miles away, China about 6,000 (effectively more, due to currents). For premodern sailors, China reaching America was nearly impossible, while Europeans had a fair chance. That is why Europeans “accidentally” discovered the Americas—a seeming accident rooted in geography.

The Age of Discovery changed everything. Europe escaped the Malthusian trap by inheriting vast, fertile North America—larger and richer even than China’s great plains. Native populations, isolated since the Ice Age, lacked developed agriculture and succumbed quickly to conquest and disease. Suddenly, Europeans had immense new lands to sustain population growth. Transatlantic trade and prosperity flourished for centuries. While eventually, Malthus would again loom, another revolution occurred first: social thought and natural science exploded, leading to the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution. This fusion of free markets and modern science launched humanity into a new era of sustained, compounding, limitless economic growth—unprecedented in history.

Unlike agriculture, limited by land, this modern system created abundance. It was founded on Economic Meritocracy. In Europe, people discovered that regardless of birth, economic advancement was open to all who strove. This unleashed the power of individuals and small collectives (companies), drawing on another side of human nature: individuality. Western civilization thrived on this in recent centuries, rooted in Europe’s fragmented states and North America’s small colonies.

This explains why China and the West so often misunderstand each other. Each judges the other through its own biases and successes. The West, succeeding through individual and corporate strength, views government with deep suspicion. My first point today is to lay the groundwork: the long, profound, and fundamental differences between China and the West.

2. China’s Path to Modernization and Its Economic Miracle of the Past Forty Years

In 1840, China met modern Western civilization through the Opium War. Forced to open its ports, it confronted a brutal truth: while still basking in its agricultural-era glory, it had entirely missed the Industrial Revolution and scientific advances that had propelled the West centuries ahead. For over a hundred years afterward, China staggered in a semi-colonial state.

In 1949, under Communist leadership, China reestablished national unity, initially adopting a planned economy. This fit well with the Chinese instinct for collective organization and mobilization. For China’s government, it was a natural choice. When nations choose their paths, deep-seated historical biases weigh heavily. The results of the planned economy are well known.

In 1978, Deng Xiaoping rose to power, uncertain of the exact route to prosperity. But he made one practical observation. As his interpreter Li Shenzhi later recalled, Deng remarked that after World War II, all nations allied with the U.S. became rich, while those allied with the Soviet Union became poor. Deng made this comment during his first U.S. visit in 1978.
