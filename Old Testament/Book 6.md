Here is a summary of the next book, **Joshua**, based on the provided text.

The Book of Joshua records the fulfillment of God's ancient promise to give the land of Canaan to Abraham's descendants. It is a book of conquest, division of inheritance, and the transition of leadership from Moses to Joshua. The central theme is God's faithfulness in giving Israel the land and the importance of obedience for possessing His blessings.

**Part 1: Entering the Promised Land (Chapters 1-5)**
- **Joshua Takes Command:** After Moses' death, the Lord commissions Joshua to lead Israel across the Jordan River. God promises to be with him and commands him to be "strong and of a good courage" and to meditate on the law day and night.
- **Rahab and the Spies:** Joshua sends two spies to Jericho. They are sheltered by a harlot named Rahab, who professes faith in the God of Israel. In return for her protection, she and her family are promised safety when Israel attacks.
- **Crossing the Jordan:** The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant step into the Jordan River. The waters miraculously part, and all Israel crosses on dry ground, just as they had crossed the Red Sea. Joshua sets up twelve stones taken from the riverbed as a memorial.
- **Renewal of Covenant:** The new generation of Israelite males is circumcised at Gilgal. They keep the Passover, and the manna ceases as they begin to eat the produce of the land. The captain of the Lord's host appears to Joshua.

**Part 2: The Conquest of Canaan (Chapters 6-12)**
- **The Fall of Jericho:** Following the Lord's unusual instructions, the Israelites march around Jericho once a day for six days. On the seventh day, they march seven times, the priests blow trumpets, the people shout, and the walls of the city collapse. The city is destroyed, and only Rahab and her family are spared.
- **Defeat at Ai and Achan's Sin:** When Israel next attacks the small city of Ai, they are defeated. The Lord reveals that someone took "accursed things" from Jericho. Achan confesses to taking a Babylonian garment, silver, and gold. He and his household are stoned, and the Lord's anger turns away.
- **Renewed Conquest:** Israel then successfully takes Ai. Joshua builds an altar on Mount Ebal and reads the law to the people, with half standing on Mount Gerizim and half on Mount Ebal, as Moses had commanded.
- **The Gibeonite Deception:** The Gibeonites, fearing Israel, use a ruse to make a treaty of peace with Joshua. When their deception is discovered, Israel honors the treaty but makes them servants.
- **Southern and Northern Campaigns:** Five Amorite kings unite to attack Gibeon. Joshua comes to their aid, and the Lord fights for Israel with hailstones and by making the sun stand still upon Gibeon. Joshua conquers the southern cities. Later, a coalition of northern kings led by Jabin is also defeated at the waters of Merom. The chapter summarizes the conquest of 31 kings.

**Part 3: Dividing the Land (Chapters 13-22)**
- **Land Yet to Be Possessed:** The Lord tells Joshua he is old and there remains much land to be possessed. He instructs Joshua to divide the land among the tribes as an inheritance.
- **Inheritance East of the Jordan:** The lands already given to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh are confirmed.
- **Caleb's Request:** Caleb, now 85 years old, reminds Joshua of Moses' promise and requests the mountain country of Hebron, which he then conquers, driving out the giants.
- **Inheritance of the Nine and a Half Tribes:** The land is divided by lot among Judah, Ephraim, and the remaining half of Manasseh. The Tabernacle is set up at Shiloh. The boundaries and cities for the remaining tribes (Benjamin, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, Dan) are described.
- **Cities of Refuge and Levitical Cities:** Joshua designates six cities of refuge for those who commit unintentional manslaughter. The Levites are given 48 cities with their suburbs scattered throughout the tribal territories.
- **Eastern Tribes Return:** The men of Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh are sent home with a blessing, having fulfilled their promise to fight alongside their brethren. They build an altar near the Jordan as a witness that they are still part of Israel, causing a brief but resolved misunderstanding.

**Part 4: Joshua's Final Words and Death (Chapters 23-24)**
- **Joshua's Farewell Address:** Joshua, now "old and stricken in age," gathers all Israel and exhorts them to be courageous and keep the law of Moses. He warns them against associating with the remaining nations and against serving other gods.
- **The Covenant Renewed at Shechem:** Joshua gathers all the tribes to Shechem. He reviews their history from Abraham to the present, recounting all the Lord's mighty acts. He challenges them to choose whom they will serve, declaring, "but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." The people vigorously affirm their commitment to serve the Lord.
- **Three Burials:** The book records the death and burial of Joshua at 110 years old, the burial of Joseph's bones (which had been carried from Egypt) in Shechem, and the death of Eleazar the high priest. This concludes the era of the conquest and leadership under Joshua.
