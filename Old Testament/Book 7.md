Here is a summary of the next book, **Judges**, based on the provided text.

The Book of Judges covers the period in Israel's history between the death of Joshua and the establishment of the monarchy. It is a cyclical story of the nation's repeated apostasy, suffering, deliverance, and decline. The book's central theme is that when God's people turn away from Him, they fall into misery, but when they cry out to Him, He raises up deliverers called "judges" to save them.

**Part 1: The Failure After Joshua (Chapters 1-3:6)**
- **Incomplete Conquest:** After Joshua's death, the tribes of Israel fail to fully drive out the Canaanite inhabitants from their allotted territories. Instead, they dwell among them and, in many cases, subject them to tribute rather than destroying them as God had commanded.
- **The Lord's Messenger:** An angel of the Lord appears and rebukes Israel for making covenants with the inhabitants of the land and failing to tear down their altars. The people weep, but the pattern of disobedience is already set.
- **A New Generation:** The book explains that another generation arose "which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel." This spiritual ignorance leads to a repeating cycle of sin.

**Part 2: The Cycle of the Judges (Chapters 3:7-16:31)**
The main body of the book presents a recurring pattern: Israel does evil in the sight of the Lord, He delivers them into the hands of enemies, the people cry out in distress, and He raises up a judge to deliver them. When the judge dies, the cycle begins again.

- **Othniel (3:7-11):** Israel serves the king of Mesopotamia for eight years. They cry to the Lord, and Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, delivers them. The land has rest for 40 years.
- **Ehud (3:12-30):** Israel serves Eglon, king of Moab, for 18 years. Ehud, a left-handed Benjamite, assassinates the obese king in his private chamber and leads Israel to victory. The land has rest for 80 years.
- **Shamgar (3:31):** A brief note mentions Shamgar, who slays 600 Philistines with an oxgoad and delivers Israel.
- **Deborah and Barak (Chapters 4-5):** Israel is oppressed by Jabin, king of Canaan, and his captain Sisera for 20 years. Deborah, a prophetess and judge, summons Barak to lead an army against Sisera. Barak refuses to go without her. God gives Israel victory, and Sisera is killed by Jael, a Kenite woman, who drives a tent peg through his temple. Deborah and Barak sing a triumphant song.
- **Gideon (Chapters 6-8):** Israel is oppressed by the Midianites for seven years. An angel appears to Gideon, calling him a "mighty man of valor." Gideon destroys the altar of Baal and, with a small army of 300 men chosen by God, defeats the vast Midianite army with trumpets, pitchers, and torches. After his victory, Gideon refuses to be king but makes an ephod that becomes a snare to Israel. The land has rest for 40 years.
- **Abimelech (Chapter 9):** After Gideon's death, his son Abimelech murders his 70 brothers and makes himself king. His reign is marked by violence and treachery. He is ultimately killed by a woman who drops a millstone on his head, ending his short, evil rule.
- **Tola and Jair (10:1-5):** Two minor judges, Tola and Jair, judge Israel for a combined 45 years.
- **Jephthah (Chapters 10:6-12:7):** Israel serves the Philistines and Ammonites for 18 years. Jephthah, an outcast son of a harlot, is called to lead. He makes a rash vow to the Lord: if he wins, he will sacrifice whatever comes out of his house to meet him. He defeats the Ammonites, but his only daughter greets him upon his return. In anguish, he fulfills his vow. He later defeats the Ephraimites in a civil conflict.
- **Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8-15):** Three minor judges rule for a combined 25 years.
- **Samson (Chapters 13-16):** Israel is oppressed by the Philistines for 40 years. An angel announces the birth of Samson to a barren woman, declaring he will be a Nazarite from the womb. Samson possesses superhuman strength but is morally weak, driven by his passions. He marries a Philistine woman, kills a lion with his bare hands, and later slays 30 Philistines. After his wife is given to another, he burns Philistine crops and slaughters many more with the jawbone of an ass. He falls in love with Delilah, who is bribed to discover the secret of his strength. After he reveals that his Nazarite vow has never been broken, Delilah has his head shaved while he sleeps. His strength leaves him, and the Philistines blind and imprison him. In death, his hair grows back, and he prays for strength one last time, pulling down the temple of Dagon, killing himself and thousands of Philistine lords.

**Part 3: The Moral Decay of Israel (Chapters 17-21)**
These final chapters are not chronological but serve as appendices illustrating the deep spiritual and moral corruption of the nation during the time of the judges. The repeated refrain is: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."

- **Micah's Idolatry (Chapters 17-18):** A man named Micah makes a private shrine with graven and molten images and hires a wandering Levite to be his personal priest. The tribe of Dan, seeking territory, steals Micah's idols and his priest, establishing them in the city of Laish (renamed Dan), setting up a center of idol worship that lasts "all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
- **The Crime at Gibeah and Civil War (Chapters 19-21):** A Levite's concubine is brutally abused and murdered by wicked men in Gibeah, a city of the tribe of Benjamin. The Levite dismembers her body and sends the pieces throughout Israel, sparking national outrage. The tribes unite to demand justice, but the Benjamites refuse to give up the guilty men. A horrific civil war ensues. The other tribes nearly annihilate the tribe of Benjamin, leaving only 600 men alive. To provide wives for the survivors, the other tribes devise a plan involving the virgins of Jabesh-gilead and a festival at Shiloh. The book ends with this grim picture of Israel's total disintegration.
