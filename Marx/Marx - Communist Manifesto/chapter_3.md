Here is a summary of **Section 3, "Socialist and Communist Literature,"** from *The Communist Manifesto*.

This chapter is a polemical survey of competing socialist doctrines that existed at the time. Marx and Engels critique these schools of thought to distinguish their own brand of "Communism" from what they consider to be flawed or inadequate alternatives. The chapter is divided into three main categories.

### 1. Reactionary Socialism

This category includes movements that critique the bourgeoisie from a backward-looking perspective, ultimately seeking to restore pre-bourgeois conditions.

- **a. Feudal Socialism:** Originating among the French and English aristocracies displaced by the bourgeoisie, this school combines lament for the lost feudal world with lampoons against the new order. It half-earnestly waves "the proletarian alms-bag" to rally the people. However, the people quickly see the "old feudal coats of arms" on its backside and abandon it. In practice, feudal socialists join in coercive measures against the working class and, despite their rhetoric, engage in capitalist business themselves (e.g., beetroot-sugar manufacturing).

- **b. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism:** This school, led by thinkers like Sismondi, represents the interests of the small medieval burghers and peasants who are being crushed by the bourgeoisie. It acutely dissects the contradictions of modern production—machinery, crises, concentration of capital—and the misery of the proletariat. However, its positive aims are reactionary and utopian: it seeks either to restore the old means of production and property relations or to cram modern means of production back into the old framework. Its last words are "corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations in agriculture."

- **c. German, or "True," Socialism:** This was a German philosophical movement that imported French socialist literature but failed to import the French social conditions along with it. German intellectuals translated French political and economic criticisms into abstract philosophical jargon (e.g., turning a critique of money into "Alienation of Humanity"). This stripped French socialism of its practical, class-struggle meaning. "True Socialism" preached the interests of "Human Nature" and "Man" rather than the proletariat. In practice, it became a tool for German absolute governments to scare the rising bourgeoisie and served as a "sweet finish" after the suppression of workers' uprisings. It ultimately represented the interests of the German petty-bourgeois Philistine.

### 2. Conservative, or Bourgeois, Socialism

This form of socialism comes from a section of the bourgeoisie itself that wishes to remedy social grievances to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society. It includes economists, philanthropists, and "hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind." Proudhon's *Philosophy of Poverty* is cited as an example.

Bourgeois socialists want a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. They desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary elements. They seek administrative reforms that leave the relationship between capital and labor untouched, lessening the cost of bourgeois government. Its ultimate expression is the claim that all policies—free trade, protective duties, prison reform—are "for the benefit of the working class." It is summed up in the phrase: "the bourgeois is a bourgeois—for the benefit of the working class."

### 3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism

This category refers to the systems of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen. These arose during the early, undeveloped period of the class struggle. Their founders saw class antagonisms but not yet an active, historically independent proletariat.

- **Their Approach:** They searched for a new social science to create the conditions for emancipation. They saw the proletariat only as the most suffering class, not as a revolutionary force. They rejected political and revolutionary action, aiming to achieve their ends peacefully through example and small-scale experiments (like Owen's "Home Colonies" or Fourier's "Phalanstères").
- **Their Significance:** They contained critical elements that attack the foundations of existing society and provided valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class. Their proposals (abolition of town-country distinction, of the family, of wage labor) pointed to the disappearance of class antagonisms.
- **Their Decline:** As the modern class struggle developed and took definite shape, these systems lost all practical value. Their followers formed mere reactionary sects, clinging to the original views of their masters and opposing the progressive historical development of the proletariat. They try to deaden the class struggle and reconcile antagonisms. The Owenites in England oppose the Chartists, and the Fourierists in France oppose the *Réformistes*.
