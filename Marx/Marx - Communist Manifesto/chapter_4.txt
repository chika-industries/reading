Here is a summary of **Section 4, "Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties,"** from *The Communist Manifesto*.

This final, brief chapter outlines the strategic and tactical approach Communists should take toward other opposition movements in different countries. It emphasizes that while Communists fight for immediate working-class interests, they never lose sight of the movement's future goal.

- **General Strategy:** Communists fight for the immediate aims of the working class, but within the present movement, they also represent and care for the future of that movement. They support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order.

- **The Central Question:** In all these movements, they bring the **property question** to the front as the fundamental issue, regardless of its current stage of development.

- **International Alliances:**
    - **In France:** Communists ally with the **Social-Democrats** against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, while still maintaining a critical position toward the revolutionary traditions and illusions of 1789.
    - **In Switzerland:** They support the **Radicals**, while recognizing that this party is composed of contradictory elements (both democratic socialists and radical bourgeois).
    - **In Poland:** They support the party that insists on an **agrarian revolution** as the foundation of national emancipation—the same party that fomented the 1846 Cracow insurrection.
    - **In Germany:** They fight alongside the **bourgeoisie** whenever it acts in a revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy, feudal squirearchy, and petty bourgeoisie.

- **Special Focus on Germany:** Communists direct their attention chiefly to Germany because it is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution. This revolution will occur under more advanced conditions of European civilization and with a much more developed proletariat than existed in 17th-century England or 18th-century France. Therefore, **"the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution."**

- **Warning to the German Workers:** Communists never cease to instill in the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat. German workers must be prepared to use the social and political conditions introduced by the bourgeoisie as weapons against the bourgeoisie itself. The fight against the bourgeoisie must begin immediately after the fall of the reactionary classes.

- **The Famous Conclusion:** The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by "the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions." The final rallying cry is one of the most famous in political literature:

> "Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
>
> **WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!**"
