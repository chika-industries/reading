Here is a summary of **Section 2, "Proletarians and Communists,"** from *The Communist Manifesto*.

This chapter clarifies the relationship between the Communists and the working class as a whole, defends communism against common bourgeois criticisms, and outlines the measures to be taken after the proletariat seizes power.

- **The Relationship of Communists to the Proletariat:** The Communists are not a separate party opposed to other working-class parties. They have no interests separate from the proletariat as a whole. Their distinguishing features are:
    1.  In national struggles, they emphasize the common interests of the entire proletariat, independent of nationality.
    2.  In all stages of the struggle, they always represent the interests of the movement as a whole.
    Practically, they are the most advanced and resolute section of working-class parties. Theoretically, they have the advantage of clearly understanding the conditions and ultimate results of the proletarian movement.

- **The Theory of Communists and Private Property:** The theoretical conclusions of Communists are not based on ideas invented by reformers. They merely express actual relations springing from an existing class struggle. The theory can be summed up in a single sentence: **Abolition of private property.**
    - This does not mean abolishing property acquired by individual labor (which industry has already largely destroyed). It means abolishing **bourgeois property**, the final and most complete expression of class antagonism.
    - Capital is a collective, social product, not a personal one. Converting it to common property only changes its social character, not abolishing property altogether but stripping it of its class character.

- **Refutation of Bourgeois Objections:**
    - **On Individuality and Freedom:** In bourgeois society, only the capitalist has independence and individuality. The worker has none. Communists are indeed aiming to abolish bourgeois individuality and freedom, which are based on free trade and free selling and buying.
    - **On Laziness:** The objection that abolishing property would end all work is nonsense. In bourgeois society, those who work acquire nothing, and those who acquire property do not work.
    - **On Culture and Law:** Bourgeois ideas of freedom, culture, and law are merely the outgrowth of bourgeois production and property. They are not eternal truths but historical products of class society.
    - **On the Family:** The bourgeois family is based on capital and private gain. It fully exists only for the bourgeoisie. Its complement is the practical absence of the family among proletarians and public prostitution. Communists are not introducing community of women; it has existed throughout history. Bourgeois marriage itself is a system of wives in common.
    - **On Country and Nationality:** "The working men have no country." National differences and antagonisms are already vanishing with the development of the bourgeoisie and the world market, and will vanish even faster under proletarian supremacy.

- **The Course of the Revolution:** The first step in the workers' revolution is to raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class and "win the battle of democracy." The proletariat will then use its political supremacy to:
    - Wrest all capital from the bourgeoisie.
    - Centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state (the proletariat organized as the ruling class).
    - Increase productive forces as rapidly as possible.

- **Transitional Measures:** A list of ten measures is provided for the most advanced countries. These include:
    1.  Abolition of property in land.
    2.  A heavy progressive income tax.
    3.  Abolition of all right of inheritance.
    4.  Centralization of credit and communication in the hands of the state.
    5.  Extension of state-owned factories and improvement of land.
    6.  Equal liability of all to labor; establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
    7.  Free public education for all children; abolition of child factory labor.

- **The Ultimate Goal:** When class distinctions disappear and all production is concentrated in the hands of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. In place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and antagonisms, "we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all."
