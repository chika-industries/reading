Here is a summary of Chapter 11 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 11: The Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value

In this relatively short but analytically dense chapter, Marx synthesizes the concepts developed in previous chapters—variable capital, the rate of surplus-value, and the working day—to establish the laws governing the total mass of surplus-value produced by a capitalist. He also explores the relationships and trade-offs between the number of workers exploited, the rate of exploitation, and the magnitude of variable capital.

#### The Foundational Assumptions

Marx begins by restating his key assumptions for this analysis:
- The value of labour-power is given and constant (a fixed sum representing the necessary means of subsistence).
- The rate of surplus-value (s/v) is therefore also given for a given working day.
- Under these conditions, the mass of surplus-value produced is determined by two factors: the rate of surplus-value and the amount of variable capital advanced.

#### The First Law: The Determinants of the Mass of Surplus-Value

Marx formulates his first law as follows:

> **The mass of surplus-value produced is equal to the amount of variable capital advanced multiplied by the rate of surplus-value.**

This can be expressed in several equivalent formulas:

- **S = (s/v) × V**, where S is the total mass of surplus-value, s/v is the rate of surplus-value (the degree of exploitation of one worker), and V is the total variable capital advanced.
- **S = (surplus labour of one worker / necessary labour of one worker) × number of workers employed.**
- **S = value of one labour-power × degree of exploitation × number of workers employed.**

In simpler terms: **the more workers a capitalist exploits, and the more he exploits each one, the greater the mass of surplus-value he appropriates.**

#### The Second Law: Compensation and Its Absolute Limit

Because the mass of surplus-value is the product of two factors (the rate of exploitation and the number of workers), a decrease in one factor can be compensated by an increase in the other—but only within limits.

- If the number of workers (and thus variable capital) falls, the mass of surplus-value can remain the same if the rate of exploitation rises proportionally. For example, if the working day is extended or its intensity increased, fewer workers can produce the same surplus-value.
- However, there is an **absolute limit to this compensation**. A single worker cannot work more than 24 hours in a day. The total value a worker can produce in a day is always less than the value embodied in 24 hours of labour. Therefore, no matter how high the rate of exploitation, a reduction in the number of workers can only be compensated up to this physical maximum.
- This law is crucial for understanding a central contradiction of capitalism: capital's tendency to *reduce* the number of workers it employs (through mechanization) constantly conflicts with its need to *increase* the mass of surplus-value, which ultimately depends on the total quantity of labour exploited.

#### The Third Law: The Relation of the Factors

Given the rate of surplus-value and the value of labour-power, the mass of surplus-value varies directly with the amount of variable capital advanced. If variable capital is zero, surplus-value is zero.

#### Practical Implications and the Minimum Capital

From these laws, Marx deduces an important practical consequence for the capitalist himself:

- If the value of labour-power and the length of the working day are fixed (as in a given society at a given time), the mass of surplus-value a capitalist can appropriate depends solely on the number of workers he employs.
- This number, in turn, depends on the amount of variable capital he can advance (his wage fund).
- However, variable capital is only one part of total capital; the capitalist must also advance constant capital (buildings, raw materials, machinery) in a proportion determined by the technical conditions of production.
- Therefore, **there is a minimum amount of total capital** required for a person to become a capitalist rather than a mere small master craftsman. He must advance enough constant capital to employ workers productively, and enough variable capital to employ a sufficient number of workers that the surplus-value he appropriates is enough to:
    1.  Provide him with a comfortable standard of living (so he doesn't have to work himself).
    2.  Allow him to accumulate and reinvest, expanding his capital.

This threshold varies between branches of industry. Below it, the producer is still a hybrid—part worker, part capitalist—and all the surplus-value he extracts must be plowed back just to stay afloat. Only above this threshold does he become a "functional capitalist," someone who lives entirely on the surplus labour of others.

In summary, Chapter 11 moves from the qualitative analysis of surplus-value's *source* to the quantitative analysis of its *mass*. It establishes the mathematical relationships that govern exploitation and shows how these abstract laws manifest in the concrete conditions of capitalist enterprise, including the minimum scale required for capitalist production to exist in its pure form.
