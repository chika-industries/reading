### Summary of Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital

Having established how surplus-value is created through the consumption of labour-power, Marx now refines his analysis by introducing a crucial distinction between two different parts of capital. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how surplus-value is measured and how capital functions in the production process.

#### The Twofold Result of Labour

In the previous chapter, Marx showed that the worker's labour has a dual effect during the production process:

1.  **It adds new value** to the product through the expenditure of abstract labour.
2.  **It preserves the existing value** of the means of production (raw materials, machinery, etc.) by transferring it to the new product through concrete, useful labour.

This is not two separate acts but two aspects of the same labour process. The worker cannot add new labour without, by the very character of that labour as concrete and useful, preserving the value of the means of production. This preservative function is "a gift of nature which costs the worker nothing, but is very advantageous to the capitalist."

#### How Means of Production Transfer Value

The means of production (raw materials, auxiliary materials, instruments of labour) do not lose their value when they are used up in production. Instead, their value is transferred to the new product. However, they transfer value only to the extent that they themselves *lose* value through being used up.

- **Raw materials** (e.g., cotton) lose their independent form and become part of the new product. Their value is fully transferred (assuming no waste).
- **Instruments of labour** (e.g., machinery) function in the labour process as a whole but transfer their value to the product only piece by piece, over their lifetime. A machine that lasts 10 years transfers approximately one-tenth of its value to each year's product.
- **Natural forces** (e.g., wind, water, virgin land) have no value because no human labour is objectified in them. They therefore transfer *no* value to the product, though they assist in creating use-value.

An important point: a means of production can never transfer more value to the product than it possesses itself. Its value is determined by the labour-time required for its *own* production, not by the process it enters into.

#### The Two Components of Capital

Based on this analysis, Marx divides the capital advanced by the capitalist into two fundamentally different parts:

1.  **Constant Capital (*c*):** That part of capital which is turned into means of production (raw materials, auxiliary materials, instruments of labour). In the production process, this part undergoes no quantitative alteration of value. Its value is merely *preserved* and transferred to the product. Hence, it is called **constant capital**.

2.  **Variable Capital (*v*):** That part of capital which is turned into labour-power. In the production process, this part does undergo an alteration of value. It reproduces its own equivalent (the worker's wages) *and* produces an excess, a surplus-value. This part is not constant but variable; it expands. Hence, it is called **variable capital**.

This distinction is absolute and essential. It corresponds to the objective and subjective factors of the labour process: means of production (objective) are constant capital; labour-power (subjective) is variable capital.

#### A Crucial Clarification: Changes in Value vs. Valorization

Marx anticipates a possible misunderstanding. Constant capital, by definition, does not *create* new value in the production process. However, its *own value* can change due to circumstances outside that process.

For example, if a new invention allows cotton to be produced with less labour, the value of existing cotton falls. If a bad harvest makes cotton production more labour-intensive, the value of existing cotton rises. These are changes in the *value* of the means of production, but they occur *outside* the production process in which they function as constant capital. They do not mean that constant capital itself *valorizes* (creates surplus-value).

Similarly, changes in the proportion of constant to variable capital (e.g., using more machinery and fewer workers) do not affect the essential distinction between their functions. One part still only preserves value; the other still creates new value and surplus-value. The distinction is qualitative, not merely quantitative.

This distinction between constant and variable capital is one of Marx's most important analytical tools. It allows him to precisely locate the source of surplus-value (in *v*, not *c*) and lays the foundation for all his subsequent analysis of exploitation, accumulation, and the laws of motion of capitalism.
