Here is a summary of Chapter 6 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 6: The Sale and Purchase of Labour-Power

This chapter provides the solution to the contradiction posed in Chapter 5. Marx identifies the unique commodity that, when consumed, creates more value than it itself costs: **labour-power**. This is the "secret" of how money is transformed into capital without violating the laws of commodity exchange.

#### The Solution to the Contradiction

Recall the problem from Chapter 5: surplus-value cannot arise from circulation, but it cannot arise apart from circulation. The change that creates surplus-value must occur in the commodity purchased in the first act (M-C), but not in its *value*, since it is bought at its value. The change must occur in the **use-value** of that commodity—in its consumption.

The capitalist must find a commodity whose use-value possesses the "peculiar property of being a source of value," whose actual consumption is itself an objectification of labour, hence a creation of value. This commodity exists: it is **labour-power** (*Arbeitskraft*), or the capacity for labour.

#### Defining Labour-Power

Marx defines labour-power as "the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in the physical form, the living personality, of a human being, which he sets in motion whenever he produces a use-value of any kind."

#### Historical Conditions for Labour-Power as a Commodity

For labour-power to appear on the market as a commodity for sale, two essential historical conditions must be met:

1.  **The Worker Must Be Free in a Double Sense:**
    - **First:** The worker must be a "free proprietor" of his own person and labour-power. He must be able to sell it as his own commodity. But he can only sell it for a *limited period*; if he sold it once and for all, he would sell himself into slavery.
    - **Second:** The worker must be "free" of any other commodities to sell. He must have no access to means of production (tools, land, raw materials) and no means of subsistence of his own. He is therefore *compelled* to sell his labour-power to survive.

2.  **The Worker Is Separated from the Means of Production:** This separation is not a natural condition but the result of a long historical process—the "extinction of a whole series of older formations of social production." It is the product of past historical development, which Marx will later explore in Part Eight on "primitive accumulation."

These conditions, taken together, constitute the historical presupposition for capital. Capital, therefore, "announces from the outset a new epoch in the process of social production."

#### The Value of Labour-Power

Like all other commodities, labour-power has a value. Its value is determined by the labour-time necessary for its production and reproduction.

But what does it mean to "produce" labour-power? Labour-power exists only as a capacity of a living individual. Its production presupposes his existence and maintenance. Therefore:

- **The value of labour-power is the value of the means of subsistence necessary to maintain its owner** (the worker) in a normal state of health and working capacity.
- This includes subsistence for the worker's **replacements** (his children), to ensure the continuance of the working class on the market.
- It also includes the costs of **training and education** required to develop skill and dexterity, though these are minimal for "simple" labour-power.
- Importantly, the value of labour-power contains a **"historical and moral element."** The level of needs (what counts as "necessary" food, clothing, housing) is itself a product of history, depending on the level of civilization, the habits and expectations formed in a given society. Nevertheless, at any given time and place, the average amount is a known datum.

The value of labour-power, therefore, resolves into the value of a definite quantity of means of subsistence. It varies with the value of those means of subsistence.

#### The Unique Use-Value of Labour-Power

This is the crucial point. The use-value of labour-power—what the capitalist gets when he consumes it—is **labour itself**. And labour is the substance and measure of value.

The value of labour-power (what the capitalist pays the worker) and the value which that labour-power can create (what the capitalist gets from the worker) are two entirely different magnitudes. The capitalist buys a day's labour-power at its value, but its use-value enables him to make the worker labour for a whole day, creating value that exceeds the cost of the day's subsistence.

This difference is "a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means an injustice towards the seller." The exchange is still an exchange of equivalents: the capitalist pays the full value of the labour-power, and the worker parts with its use-value for the agreed period.

#### The Scene of Production

Marx concludes the chapter with a famous and dramatic passage. Having found the "special commodity" that solves the riddle, he invites the reader to leave the noisy sphere of circulation—the "exclusive realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham"—and follow the owner of money and the owner of labour-power into the "hidden abode of production." On the threshold of the factory hangs the notice: "No admittance except on business." Here, they will discover not only how capital produces, but also how capital is itself produced.

The chapter ends by contrasting the two actors: the capitalist, "smirking self-importantly and intent on business," and the worker, "timid and holding back, like someone who has brought his own hide to market and now has nothing else to expect but—a tanning."
