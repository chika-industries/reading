Here is a summary of Chapter 5 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 5: Contradictions in the General Formula

In this short but critical chapter, Marx examines the apparent paradox at the heart of the general formula for capital (M-C-M'). He demonstrates that surplus-value *cannot* arise from the sphere of circulation itself, yet it *must* arise from somewhere within it. This sets up the necessary conditions for the solution he will provide in the following chapter.

#### The Problem Restated

The general formula for capital—buying in order to sell dearer—seems to contradict all the previously established laws of commodity exchange. In simple circulation (C-M-C), the process begins and ends with commodities of different use-values but equal value. But in M-C-M', the process begins and ends with money, and the whole point is for the final sum to be *greater* than the initial sum.

How can a mere change in the *order* of the two acts (purchase then sale, instead of sale then purchase) magically create new value?

#### Circulation Creates No Value

Marx systematically eliminates the possibility that surplus-value arises from circulation itself:

- **Exchange of Equivalents:** If all commodities, including money, are exchanged at their values, then no surplus-value is possible. The seller gets exactly the value of his commodity in money, and the buyer gives exactly the value of the money in the commodity. The sum of values in society remains unchanged; it is merely redistributed. "Circulation, or the exchange of commodities, creates no value."

- **Exchange of Non-Equivalents:** Could surplus-value arise from selling commodities above their value or buying them below their value?
    - **Selling Above Value:** If all sellers have the privilege of selling 10% above value, what they gain as sellers, they lose as buyers when they purchase from other sellers who are also charging 10% above value. The net result is zero.
    - **Buying Below Value:** Similarly, if all buyers have the privilege of buying 10% below value, they lose as sellers what they gain as buyers.
    - **Cheating:** If one clever seller manages to cheat another by buying cheap and selling dear, the gain for one is exactly balanced by the loss for the other. The total value in circulation has not increased; it has only been redistributed. The capitalist class as a whole cannot enrich itself by defrauding itself.

#### The Origin Must Be Both in Circulation and Not in Circulation

Having eliminated all possibilities within the sphere of circulation, Marx arrives at a famous "double result":

1.  **Surplus-value cannot arise from circulation.** The exchange of commodities, whether of equivalents or non-equivalents, cannot create new value.
2.  **Surplus-value cannot arise apart from circulation.** Outside the sphere of circulation, a commodity owner stands in isolation with his own commodity. He can add value to it through additional labour (e.g., turning leather into boots), but he cannot create a *surplus-value*—an excess over the value he started with—without coming into contact with other commodity owners.

Therefore, the transformation of money into capital "must have its origin both in circulation and not in circulation." This is the contradiction, the "conditions of the problem."

#### The Path Forward

The formula for capital requires the exchange of equivalents, yet the capitalist must end up with more value than he started with. The solution, Marx states, cannot be found in the money itself (it merely realizes prices) nor in the act of resale (which merely converts the commodity back into money). The change must therefore take place in the **commodity purchased in the first act, M-C**.

But it cannot be a change in the *value* of that commodity, as it is bought at its full value. The change must occur in the **use-value** of that commodity, in its consumption. The capitalist must be fortunate enough to find a commodity on the market whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption is itself an objectification of labour, and therefore a *creation of value*.

This sets the stage for Chapter 6, where Marx will introduce that unique commodity: **labour-power**. The problem is now clearly defined, and the reader is prepared for its solution.
