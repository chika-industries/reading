Here is a summary of Chapter 15 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry

This is the longest and one of the most important chapters in *Capital*, Volume 1. It represents the culmination of Marx's analysis of the production of relative surplus-value. In it, he examines the transition from manufacture (based on handicraft skill and division of labour) to **large-scale industry** (*die grosse Industrie*), which is based on **machinery**. Machinery fundamentally transforms the labour process, the nature of work, the composition of the working class, and the relationship between worker and capitalist. The chapter is divided into ten sections.

#### 1. The Development of Machinery

Marx begins by distinguishing machinery from tools. The machine, in its developed form, consists of three parts:
- **The motor mechanism:** The prime mover (steam engine, water wheel) that generates power.
- **The transmitting mechanism:** Gears, shafts, belts, etc., that convey and regulate motion.
- **The tool or working machine:** The part that directly acts on the material, essentially a mechanism that operates the same tools a worker would use, but now with many of them at once.

The crucial point is that **the machine seizes hold of the tool**, not the worker. What the worker once held and guided with his skill is now built into a mechanism. The machine, therefore, **revolutionizes the mode of production**. It replaces the skilled, individualized labour of the craftsman or the detail worker in manufacture with the mechanical power of a system of machines.

This development has profound consequences. Machinery does not arise from a desire to lighten the worker's toil; it arises from capital's drive to increase productivity and subdue the worker's resistance. As Marx notes, "it would be possible to write quite a history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working-class revolt."

#### 2. The Value Transferred by the Machinery to the Product

Machinery, like all means of production, transfers its value to the product piece by piece through wear and tear. However, Marx emphasizes a crucial point: **machinery creates no new value**. It only transfers its own value, bit by bit, to the commodities it helps produce.

The productivity of machinery is measured by the degree to which it replaces human labour. For a machine to be economically viable for the capitalist, the portion of its value transferred to the daily product must be **less than the value of the labour-power it displaces**. The limit of machine production is not absolute labour-saving but the difference between the cost of the machine and the cost of the wages it replaces.

This leads to a contradiction: machinery is the most powerful means of increasing productivity, but its use by capital is limited by the very wage system it creates. It is not used to shorten the working day for all, but to extract more labour from those it employs.

#### 3. The Most Immediate Effects of Machine Production on the Worker

Marx details the devastating impact of machinery on the working class:

- **a) Appropriation of Supplementary Labour-Power (Women and Children):** Machinery simplifies labour, making it possible to employ workers with less muscular strength and skill. Capital therefore throws women and children into the factory. This is a double victory for capital: it increases the supply of exploitable labourers and it breaks the resistance of the adult male worker by surrounding him with cheaper, more docile family labour. The wage of the whole family is now divided, forcing everyone into the factory. Children are robbed of childhood, and the family structure is torn apart.
- **b) Prolongation of the Working Day:** Machinery creates new conditions that drive capital to extend the working day. First, the rapid wear and tear of machinery (both physical and "moral" due to obsolescence) creates an incentive to extract as much value as possible from it before it becomes outdated. Second, the value transferred by the machine to the product is spread over a longer working day, making the machine relatively cheaper to use per hour. Third, the more machinery is used, the more surplus-value it yields. These pressures combine to push the working day to its limits and beyond.
- **c) Intensification of Labour:** When legal limits are finally placed on the working day (as discussed in Chapter 10), capital responds by *intensifying* labour—making the worker expend more labour-power in the same amount of time. This is achieved through:
    - **Increased speed of machinery** (running machines faster).
    - **Increased "feed" of machinery** (requiring the worker to mind more machines simultaneously).
    - **Improved factory design and supervision** to eliminate idle moments.

This intensification is as exhausting and damaging as lengthening the day, leading to nervous exhaustion and physical deterioration.

#### 4. The Factory

Marx paints a vivid picture of the factory as a "vast automaton," composed of numerous mechanical and conscious organs working in harmony. In this setting, the worker is reduced to a mere appendage of the machine. His movements are dictated by the machine's rhythm; his labour is stripped of all intellectual content. The factory is a "barracks-like" discipline, with a strict, military-style code of rules, fines, and punishments. The worker is trained to "abjure his freedom of will" and submit to the automatic despotism of the mechanism.

#### 5. The Struggle between Worker and Machine

Because machinery appears to the worker as the direct cause of his suffering and displacement, the early stages of capitalism are marked by violent struggles **against the machines themselves**. Marx recounts the history of Luddism in England, where workers smashed machinery in a desperate attempt to resist their own obsolescence. He notes that it took time and experience for workers to learn to distinguish between the *machine* and its *capitalist use*, and to direct their struggle not at the technological means but at the social form of their exploitation.

#### 6. The Compensation Theory

Bourgeois economists argued that machinery, while displacing workers in one place, would inevitably "compensate" by creating new jobs elsewhere (e.g., in the industries that make the machines, or in the expanded production made possible by cheaper goods). Marx demolishes this "compensation theory":

- The workers displaced from a particular trade are thrown onto the streets; they are not automatically absorbed elsewhere. There is no law of capitalism that guarantees them re-employment.
- The industries that produce machinery do employ workers, but these are far fewer than those displaced, and they require different skills.
- The capital used to buy machinery was formerly used to pay wages. It is now laid out in constant capital, not variable capital. The immediate effect is a *reduction* in the total demand for labour, not an increase.
- The cheapening of commodities may expand demand, but this expansion is uncertain and does not necessarily re-employ the same workers. In many cases, it leads to further concentration of production and further displacement.

#### 7. Repulsion and Attraction of Workers through the Development of Machine Production: Crises in the Cotton Industry

Marx analyzes the dynamic and contradictory effects of machinery on employment. Machinery both **repels** workers (by making them redundant) and **attracts** them (by creating new branches of production or expanding old ones). This process is highly uneven and occurs in waves, closely tied to the industrial cycle of boom and crisis.

He illustrates this with the English cotton industry, showing how periods of rapid expansion (attraction) are followed by crises and technological improvements that displace workers (repulsion), leaving a permanent "reserve army" of labour. The development of machinery, therefore, does not lead to a smooth absorption of the working population but to its constant fluctuation and precarious existence.

#### 8. The Revolutionary Impact of Large-Scale Industry on Manufacture, Handicrafts and Domestic Industry

Large-scale industry systematically destroys the older forms of production:

- **Overthrow of Co-operation and Manufacture:** Machine production undercuts the products of handicrafts and manufacture by making them cheaper. It replaces the skilled, specialized worker with machine-minders.
- **Impact on Manufacture and Domestic Industries:** Marx details how industries like pottery, glass-making, and nail-making were first transformed by the introduction of machinery in some parts and the intensification of labour in others. He shows the horrifying conditions in "modern domestic industry" (e.g., lace-making, straw-plaiting), where workers, often women and children, toiled in overcrowded, unhealthy dwellings for starvation wages, under the indirect control of merchant capitalists. This was not a survival of pre-capitalist forms but a new creation of capital, combining the worst of factory exploitation with the isolation of domestic work.
- **Transition to Large-Scale Industry:** Eventually, even these forms are swept away by the direct application of machinery. The Factory Acts, once applied to these industries, accelerate this process by forcing the adoption of machinery to maintain profitability under regulated hours.

#### 9. The Health and Education Clauses of the Factory Acts: The General Extension of Factory Legislation in England

Marx examines the provisions of the Factory Acts regarding health and education. He notes that the health clauses were rudimentary (whitewashing walls, ventilation) and often evaded. The education clauses were more significant, however, because they established the **first recognition of the need for elementary education for working-class children** as a legal requirement.

Marx sees in this a historic contradiction: capitalist production, which cripples the worker and stunts his development, is forced by its own contradictions to concede the necessity of some education. He also notes that the Factory Acts, by regulating hours and conditions, inadvertently laid the foundation for the technical education of the worker, breaking down the old division of labour and creating the potential for a fully developed individual. This is one of capitalism's unintended progressive consequences.

#### 10. Large-Scale Industry and Agriculture

In the final section, Marx briefly considers the application of machinery to agriculture. He argues that here, too, the same laws apply: machinery displaces agricultural labourers, concentrates landownership, and intensifies exploitation. However, in agriculture, the destruction of the worker's vitality is combined with the **exhaustion of the soil**. Large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture under capitalism work together to undermine the two original sources of all wealth: the earth and the worker.

---

In summary, Chapter 15 provides a comprehensive analysis of machinery as the characteristic instrument of large-scale industry. Machinery is not neutral; under capitalism, it is a weapon in the class struggle, a means of increasing exploitation, and a force that degrades, displaces, and controls the worker. It creates a constantly changing division of labour, a floating surplus population, and a system of production that is simultaneously immensely productive and immensely destructive of human life and natural resources.
