### Summary of Chapter 10: The Working Day

This is one of the longest and most powerful chapters in *Capital*. Having established the theoretical framework for understanding surplus-value, Marx now turns to the historical and empirical reality of the struggle over the length of the working day. He argues that the working day is not a fixed quantity but a fluid one, determined not by natural laws or economic logic alone, but by the relentless conflict between capital's drive for unlimited exploitation and labour's fight for its own self-preservation.

#### 1. The Limits of the Working Day

The working day is a variable quantity. It consists of **necessary labour-time** (the time required to reproduce the value of labour-power) and **surplus labour-time** (the time during which the worker works for free). Necessary labour-time is given (under assumed conditions), but surplus labour-time can be extended or contracted.

The working day has maximum limits:
- **Physical limits:** The worker needs time for rest, sleep, food, and other bodily needs.
- **Moral and social limits:** The worker needs time to satisfy intellectual and social requirements, which depend on the general level of civilization.

These limits are elastic, not fixed. Capital, as "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour," strives to extend the working day to its absolute maximum—to consume labour-power as much as possible within 24 hours. The worker, however, demands a **normal working day**—one that preserves his health and allows for human development. The capitalist asserts his right as a buyer to consume the commodity he has purchased; the worker asserts his right as a seller not to have his only commodity destroyed.

This is an **antinomy, right against right**. Between equal rights, **force decides**. The history of capitalist production is therefore a history of struggle over the limits of the working day.

#### 2. The Voracious Appetite for Surplus Labour: Manufacturer and Boyar

Capital did not invent surplus labour; it has existed in all class societies (slavery, serfdom). But earlier forms of surplus labour were limited by the specific needs of the ruling class. Under capitalism, the drive for surplus labour becomes **boundless**.

Marx compares the capitalist's appetite to that of a Wallachian boyar (a feudal lord). In the corvée system, the serf's necessary labour (on his own field) and surplus labour (on the lord's estate) are visibly separate. This makes the exploitation transparent. Under capitalism, the two are intermingled, obscuring the reality. But the quantitative relation is the same: both systems extract surplus labour.

Marx then provides a damning indictment of the *Reglement Organique*, a Russian-imposed legal code in the Danubian Principalities that legally codified the boyars' theft of the peasants' labour-time. By cynical definitions of what constituted a "day's work," the code transformed 12 nominal days of corvée into 56 actual days. This, Marx says, was a "positive expression" of the appetite for surplus labour. The English Factory Acts, by contrast, are the **negative expression** of the same appetite—laws forced upon capital to curb its excesses.

#### 3. Branches of English Industry without Legal Limits to Exploitation

Marx presents a horrifying catalogue of conditions in industries not yet regulated by the Factory Acts, drawing on official Parliamentary reports and public health inquiries:

- **Lace trade:** Children of 9 or 10 worked from 2, 3, or 4 a.m. until 10, 11, or 12 at night, reduced to a "stone-like torpor."
- **Potteries (Staffordshire):** A "degenerated population," stunted growth, high rates of chest diseases, and the specific "potter's asthma." Children as young as 7 worked 15-hour days.
- **Match manufacture:** Workers, many of them children, suffered from tetanus and other diseases due to phosphorus. The work was so horrible that only the most destitute would take it.
- **Wallpaper printing:** Children worked 16-hour days, often kept awake only by being shouted at. One father testified that he carried his 7-year-old boy to work through the snow and had to feed him while he stood at the machine.
- **Baking:** London bakers worked 17 or 18 hours a day, often in intense heat, with little sleep. The "underselling masters" thrived on the "unpaid labour" of their men.
- **Railways:** Guards and drivers were often worked 14, 18, or even 50 consecutive hours, leading to catastrophic accidents.
- **Milliners and dressmakers:** Mary Anne Walkley, a 20-year-old milliner, died from working 26½ hours without a break in an overcrowded, airless workroom. The coroner's jury, coached by a doctor, returned a verdict of "apoplexy" while noting that death was "accelerated by over-work."
- **Blacksmiths:** Forced to work beyond their natural capacity, their life expectancy dropped from 50 to 37.

#### 4. Day-Work and Night-Work: The Shift System

Capital's drive to appropriate labour for the entire 24-hour day leads to the shift system, where workers alternate between day and night shifts. This system, common in metallurgical industries, allows capital to keep its expensive machinery running continuously. Marx documents the appalling conditions: children as young as 8 working night shifts, sometimes for 36 consecutive hours, sleeping on the floors of furnaces. The manufacturers' objections to limiting night-work are brutally cynical: they can't afford to hire adult men because it would cost more, and boys are more "obedient."

#### 5. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day: Laws for the Compulsory Extension of the Working Day (14th-17th Centuries)

Marx now provides a historical overview of the struggle. In an ironic twist, he shows that the earliest labour laws (from the 14th to the 17th century) were designed not to *limit* the working day but to **forcibly extend it**. After the Black Death created a labour shortage, the state stepped in to compel workers to accept longer hours and lower wages. These statutes, which fixed maximum wages and minimum working days, were a form of class legislation by the emerging capitalist class, aided by the state.

#### 6. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day: Laws for the Compulsory Limitation of Working Hours (1833-1864)

With the rise of large-scale industry in the late 18th century, capital's "orgies" of exploitation reached intolerable levels. The working class began to resist. Marx traces the key Factory Acts:

- **1833 Act:** First effective act, limited to textile factories. Forbidden night-work for under-18s. Limited children (9-13) to 8 hours, "young persons" (13-18) to 12 hours. Introduced the "relay system" (shifts of children) which was later abused.
- **1844 Act:** Protected women over 18 for the first time (12 hours, no night-work). Reduced children's hours to 6½. Attempted to regulate the relay system.
- **1847 Act:** The "Ten Hours' Bill," won after years of Chartist agitation. Limited the working day for women and young persons to 10 hours.
- **1848-1850:** Capital's counter-attack. Manufacturers launched a "pro-slavery rebellion," exploiting loopholes, intimidating workers, and using friendly magistrates to evade the law. The relay system was reintroduced in chaotic forms, with workers dragged in and out of the factory in "scattered shreds of time."
- **1850 Compromise Act:** A settlement. Working day for women and young persons fixed at 10½ hours (10 on weekdays, 7½ on Saturday), with work confined to the 12-hour period between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. The relay system was effectively ended. This became the basis for all subsequent legislation.
- **1853 Act:** Finally prohibited employment of children outside the hours fixed for women and young persons, closing the last major loophole.
- **1860-1864:** Factory legislation was gradually extended to other industries: dye-works, bleach-works, lace factories, potteries, match-making, cartridges, and baking.

#### 7. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day: Impact on Other Countries

Marx concludes the chapter with some reflections:

- England was the battleground where the modern working class fought for a limit on exploitation. Its theorists (like Robert Owen) first threw down the gauntlet to capital.
- France followed, with its 1848 Twelve Hours' Law, though it had many loopholes.
- In the United States, the death of slavery gave birth to the **eight hours' agitation** after the Civil War. The working-class movement on both sides of the Atlantic recognized that the limitation of the working day is a "preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvement and emancipation must prove abortive."
- The worker emerges from the process of production transformed. In the market, he appeared as a "free agent" selling his labour-power. But the contract reveals that he is no free agent; he is forced to sell himself. The only protection against the "vampire" of capital is to "put their heads together and, as a class, compel the passing of a law." The "inalienable rights of man" are replaced by the "Magna Carta of the legally limited working day," which finally makes clear "when the time which the worker sells is ended, and when his own begins."

This chapter is Marx's most detailed empirical demonstration of his theoretical argument. The drive for absolute surplus-value (extending the working day) leads to a brutal, life-destroying conflict that can only be resolved through class struggle and state intervention.
