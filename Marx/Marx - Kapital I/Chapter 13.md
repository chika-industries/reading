### Summary of Chapter 13: Co-operation

With this chapter, Marx begins his concrete analysis of the various forms through which capital increases the productive power of labour to produce relative surplus-value. The first and most basic form is **co-operation**—the simple bringing together of many workers to labour simultaneously on the same task or on related tasks under the command of the same capitalist.

#### What Is Co-operation?

Co-operation is, in its simplest definition, "the form of labour in which many work together, according to a plan, in the same process of production, or in different but connected processes."

This is not an invention of capitalism. Co-operation has existed in all historical epochs—in hunting societies, in agriculture, in the construction of monuments by ancient civilizations. However, under capitalism, co-operation takes on a specific historical form: it is the co-operation of many **wage-labourers** employed by the same **capital**, working together to produce **surplus-value** for that capital.

#### The Capitalist as Commander

When many workers are brought together under one roof, the capitalist's role is transformed. He is no longer just an owner of means of production; he becomes a **commander** and a **manager**.

- **The labour of oversight and management** becomes a necessary function. Just as an army requires officers, a combined labour process requires a directing authority. This authority is vested in the capitalist, but it is a function that arises from the *social* character of the labour, not from any personal qualities of the capitalist.
- This authority is, however, necessarily **despotic**. The capitalist's command is not for the common good of the workers but for the single purpose of valorizing capital. As co-operation expands, this despotism takes on its own forms—first a foreman, then a hierarchy of managers and overseers. The capitalist, having handed over the work of "spiritually directing" the labour process to these subordinates, becomes a "usurer" of other men's labour.

#### The Sources of Increased Productive Power

Why does co-operation increase the productive power of labour? Marx identifies several reasons:

1.  **Raising the Mechanical Force of Labour:** Many hands make light work. Tasks requiring great strength (lifting heavy loads, moving large objects) can only be performed collectively.
2.  **Economy of Scale in the Means of Production:** A workshop housing 20 workers costs less to build and heat than 20 separate workshops. Tools and materials can be shared. This **economizes constant capital**. A smaller proportion of capital is tied up in buildings, heating, lighting, etc., leaving more available for wages and raw materials. This, in turn, cheapens commodities and increases the rate of surplus-value.
3.  **Creating a New, Socially Productive Power:** The combined labour of many produces a result that is not just the sum of individual efforts. When many work together in a coordinated way, they create a new collective power. The social contact of labour stimulates emulation and heightens individual exertion.
4.  **Performing Complex Tasks:** Combined labour can carry out complex operations that require the simultaneous performance of different tasks in different places (e.g., building a house requires workers on the roof, on the ground, and inside at the same time).
5.  **Concentrating Labour in Time and Space:** Work can be done more intensively in a given period, and the spatial range of the work can be extended (e.g., draining a marsh, building an irrigation system).

#### The Key Insight: Social Labour Becomes a Power of Capital

Marx's most important point in this chapter is that under capitalist co-operation, the increased productive power of combined labour does not appear as a power of the *workers* but as a power of *capital*.

- The workers are brought together and coordinated by *capital*. Their co-operation does not exist before they enter the workplace; it is imposed upon them by the capitalist who hires them.
- Therefore, the social productive power of their combined labour appears as a productive power *inherent in capital itself*. It seems as if capital, not the workers, is the source of this increased productivity.
- The worker's own labour, performed in isolation, is now dwarfed by the collective giant of which he is merely a part. He is subsumed under the command of a will that is not his own—the will of capital.

#### Historical and Conceptual Significance

Co-operation is the starting point of capitalist production. Historically, it was the first form in which scattered individual producers were brought together under the command of a single capitalist. Logically, it is the foundation upon which all more complex forms of capitalist production (manufacture and large-scale industry) are built.

However, Marx notes that in its simple form, co-operation does not yet fundamentally alter the mode of production. The workers still use their own individual skills and tools, but they do so together. The real transformation of the labour process begins with the next stage: the division of labour in manufacture.

In summary, Chapter 13 establishes that the mere act of assembling workers under one roof and directing their combined activity creates a new, socially productive power. But under capitalist relations, this power is immediately appropriated by capital and appears as capital's own power, further subordinating the worker to the capitalist's command.
