Here is a summary of Chapter 1 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 1: The Commodity

Marx begins his analysis of the capitalist mode of production by examining its most basic and elementary form: **the commodity**. He argues that the wealth of capitalist societies appears as an "immense collection of commodities," and therefore understanding the commodity is the foundation for understanding the entire system. The chapter is broken down into four key sections.

#### 1. The Two Factors of the Commodity: Use-Value and Value

A commodity is first and foremost an external object that satisfies a human need, regardless of the nature of that need.

- **Use-Value:** This is the utility of a thing, its ability to satisfy a need. Use-value is conditioned by the physical properties of the commodity and is realized only in consumption. It constitutes the material content of wealth, regardless of society's form. Use-values differ qualitatively.

- **Exchange-Value:** This appears as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which use-values of one kind exchange for use-values of another kind (e.g., x of commodity A = y of commodity B). It seems accidental and relative.

Marx argues that this apparent relativity hides a common element. By equating different commodities in exchange (e.g., 1 quarter of corn = x cwt of iron), we imply they are equal to a third thing, which is neither one nor the other. This common element cannot be a natural property of the commodity, as these are abstracted from in the exchange relation.

If we abstract from a commodity's use-value, we also abstract from the concrete useful labour that produced it. What remains is the quality of being a **product of labour**. But even this labour is abstracted from its concrete form. The residue is a mere "congealed quantities of homogeneous human labour," the expenditure of human labour-power in the abstract. This common social substance is what makes commodities values.

- **Value:** This is the "phantom-like objectivity" of congealed abstract human labour contained in a commodity. Exchange-value is the necessary form of appearance, or mode of expression, of this underlying value.

- **Magnitude of Value:** The magnitude of a commodity's value is measured by the quantity of the "value-forming substance," labour, which is itself measured by its duration. However, this is not just any labour-time, but **socially necessary labour-time**: the time required to produce a use-value under normal conditions of production, with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent in a society. Therefore, the value of a commodity varies directly with the quantity, and inversely with the productivity, of the labour that produces it. A thing can be a use-value without being a value (e.g., air, virgin soil), and a product of labour can be a use-value without being a commodity (e.g., a peasant's produce for his own use). To be a commodity, it must be a use-value for others, transferred through exchange.

#### 2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities

Marx considers this "crucial" to understanding political economy. The dual nature of the commodity (use-value and value) stems from the dual nature of the labour that produces it.

- **Concrete Useful Labour:** This is labour expended in a specific form, with a definite purpose, using particular skills and materials (e.g., the work of a tailor or a weaver). It creates **use-value**. It is a condition of human existence independent of all social forms.

- **Abstract Labour:** This is labour considered as the expenditure of human labour-power in general, the "productive expenditure of human brains, muscles, nerves, hands." It creates **value**. It is a social characteristic specific to commodity production. Complex labour is treated as multiplied simple labour.

This distinction explains how an increase in the quantity of use-values (material wealth) can correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of their value. If productivity rises, more use-values are produced in the same time, but the total value remains the same, so the value of each individual unit falls. This is because productivity affects *concrete* useful labour, but has no impact on the total *abstract* labour expended.

#### 3. The Value-Form, or Exchange-Value

A commodity's value is not something that can be perceived directly; it only manifests itself through the social relation between commodities. This section traces the historical and logical development of the form of value, culminating in money. Marx analyses four forms:

- **A. The Simple, Isolated, or Accidental Form of Value:** (e.g., 20 yards of linen = 1 coat). Here, the linen's value is expressed in the use-value of the coat.
    - The **relative form of value** is the commodity whose value is being expressed (the linen). It shows its value is something relative, depending on another commodity.
    - The **equivalent form** is the commodity used to express value (the coat). It serves as the material in which value is manifested. A key peculiarity of the equivalent form is that **use-value becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, value**.

- **B. The Total or Expanded Form of Value:** (e.g., 20 yards of linen = 1 coat OR = 10 lbs of tea OR = 40 lbs of coffee, etc.). Here, the value of linen is expressed in countless other commodities. This shows that value is not tied to any one particular use-value, but the expression is incomplete and a "motley mosaic."

- **C. The General Form of Value:** (e.g., 1 coat, 10 lbs of tea, 40 lbs of coffee, etc. = 20 yards of linen). All commodities now express their value in a single, common commodity (here, linen). This commodity becomes the **universal equivalent**. All labour is now presented as congealed, undifferentiated human labour.

- **D. The Money Form:** This is the same as the General Form, except the role of universal equivalent has become socially entrenched and fixed to a specific commodity, historically **gold**. When linen is replaced by gold, we get the money form (e.g., 20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold). The price form is the expression of a commodity's value in this money commodity.

#### 4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and Its Secret

This is a profound analysis of the peculiar and deceptive nature of commodities. The mysterious character of a commodity does not arise from its use-value or from the content of value-determination (labour-time). It arises from the **commodity-form itself**.

In a society of commodity producers, the social character of people's labour is only recognized *after the fact*, through the exchange of the products of their labour. Consequently, the social relation between their private labours does not appear as a direct social relation between persons, but as a **material (dinglich) relation between persons and a social relation between things** (the products themselves).

The products of labour, as commodities, reflect back to the producers the social characteristics of their own labour as if they were objective properties of those products. It's as if the table, instead of being just wood, evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas. This is analogous to the "misty realm of religion," where products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures (gods) with lives of their own. Marx calls this **fetishism**, which is inseparable from commodity production.

This fetishism conceals the fact that value is a social relation. It makes the social determination of value by labour-time appear as a thing, a property bestowed by nature. The discovery of labour-time as the source of value destroys the semblance of accidental determination but does not abolish the *material form* of that determination. The categories of bourgeois economics (value, money, etc.) are socially valid, and therefore objective, forms of thought for the relations of production in this historically specific mode of production. This mystification disappears only when we consider other forms of production, such as Robinson Crusoe on his island, medieval serfdom, a peasant family working for itself, or a future "association of free men" where labour-time is consciously planned and distributed. In bourgeois society, however, the social life-process, the process of material production, wears a veil that is only removed when it becomes production by freely associated men under their conscious control.
