### Summary of Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus-Value

With the distinction between constant capital (c) and variable capital (v) established, Marx now develops the tools to measure the precise degree of exploitation. This chapter introduces the key concept of the **rate of surplus-value** and provides a rigorous method for calculating it.

#### 1. The Degree of Exploitation of Labour-Power

Marx begins with the formula for the value of the product. If a capitalist advances capital C = c + v (constant capital + variable capital), and the production process yields a surplus-value (s), then the value of the resulting commodity is C' = (c + v) + s.

However, this formula can be misleading because c merely reappears; it creates no new value. The value *actually created* by the workers in the process—the **value-product**—is not c + v + s, but **v + s**. The constant capital c contributes nothing to the creation of new value; it is merely transferred.

Therefore, to analyze the creation of surplus-value in its pure form, Marx sets c = 0. This is a legitimate mathematical operation, analogous to ignoring irrelevant factors in an experiment. By abstracting from constant capital, the focus falls entirely on the relationship between variable capital and surplus-value.

The **rate of surplus-value** is therefore expressed as:
**s/v**

This ratio measures the valorization of variable capital—the degree to which capital expands through the exploitation of labour-power.

Marx then introduces two corresponding concepts related to the working day:

- **Necessary Labour:** The portion of the working day during which the worker reproduces the value of his own labour-power (his wages). This labour is "necessary" for the worker's survival and for capital's continued supply of labour-power.
- **Surplus Labour:** The portion of the working day during which the worker works beyond necessary labour, creating value that the capitalist appropriates for free. This is the source of surplus-value.

The rate of surplus-value can therefore also be expressed as:
**surplus labour / necessary labour**

This is the same relationship as s/v, but expressed in terms of living, fluid labour-time rather than objectified value. Both formulas are exact expressions for the **degree of exploitation of labour-power by capital**.

Marx illustrates this with examples, including a detailed breakdown of a spinning mill (showing a rate of 153¹¹ /₁₃ %) and a calculation from Jacob's agricultural data (showing over 100%). These demonstrate that the apparent rate of profit (s/(c+v)) is much lower than the actual rate of exploitation (s/v), concealing the true extent of exploitation.

#### 2. The Representation of the Value of the Product by Corresponding Proportional Parts of the Product

In this section, Marx shows how the abstract components of value (c, v, s) can be seen as embodied in *physical portions* of the total product. Using his example of 20 lbs. of yarn worth 30 shillings:

- **16 lbs. of yarn** (eight-tenths of the product) represent the **constant capital** (24 shillings). This portion contains the value of the cotton and the worn spindle, and appears as if it were just cotton and spindle in disguise. The labour of spinning seems to have vanished from this part.
- **4 lbs. of yarn** (two-tenths of the product) represent the **newly created value** (6 shillings). Of these 4 lbs.:
    - **2 lbs.** represent the **variable capital** (3 shillings), the value that replaces wages.
    - **2 lbs.** represent the **surplus-value** (3 shillings), the value created for the capitalist.

This "spatial" representation can also be viewed "temporally"—as if the worker produces the equivalent of the cotton in the first part of the day, the machinery in the next, his wages in the next, and finally the surplus-value in the "last hour." While this method of calculation is used by manufacturers, it can lead to dangerous misunderstandings, as Marx will now show.

#### 3. Senior's "Last Hour"

Marx launches a fierce critique of Nassau W. Senior, a prominent economist who argued, based on manufacturers' claims, that the *entire net profit* of a factory was produced in the "last hour" of the working day. Senior claimed that reducing the working day by one hour would therefore destroy all profit.

Marx systematically demolishes this argument. He points out the basic error: Senior treats the *value* of the product as if it were produced *instantaneously* in each hour, ignoring that the means of production (cotton, machinery) transfer their value *throughout* the whole working day.

In reality, the worker's labour *simultaneously*:
- Preserves and transfers the value of the means of production (through its quality as concrete labour).
- Creates new value (through its quantity as abstract labour).

The "last hour" is no more special than any other hour. The worker does not "produce" the value of the cotton in one part of the day and "produce" profit in another. He *preserves* the cotton's value all day long, while *adding* new value all day long. Senior's "analysis" is a muddle that serves only the apologetic interests of the manufacturers. The real issue is not which *hour* produces profit, but what *portion* of the working day is unpaid.

#### 4. The Surplus Product

Marx concludes the chapter by introducing the concept of the **surplus product**. Just as surplus-value is that portion of the *value* of the product representing surplus labour, the surplus product is the physical portion of the product in which that surplus-value is embodied.

The relative magnitude of the surplus product is determined by its ratio, not to the total product, but to that part of the product which represents necessary labour. Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the wealth of a capitalist society is measured not by the absolute quantity of its products, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product.

This chapter, therefore, provides the essential quantitative tools for analyzing exploitation and lays the groundwork for the next chapter's historical and empirical examination of the struggle over the length of the working day.
