Here is a summary of Chapter 12 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value

With this chapter, Marx begins Part Four of *Capital*, shifting the analysis from the production of **absolute surplus-value** (based on lengthening the working day) to the production of **relative surplus-value** (based on shortening necessary labour-time). This marks a qualitative leap in the development of capitalist production.

#### The Two Paths to Increasing Surplus-Value

Marx begins by summarizing the two methods capitalists can use to extract more surplus-value from workers:

1.  **Absolute Surplus-Value:** This is produced by *lengthening the working day* beyond the point where the worker has reproduced the value of his labour-power. If the necessary labour-time is fixed, the longer the total working day, the greater the surplus-value. This was the dominant method in the early stages of capitalism and was examined in Part Three.

2.  **Relative Surplus-Value:** This is produced by *shortening the necessary labour-time* within the working day. If the total working day is fixed (say, at 12 hours), the surplus-value can still be increased if the portion of the day required to reproduce wages is reduced. The worker then spends a smaller proportion of the day working for himself and a larger proportion working for the capitalist, even though the total hours remain the same.

#### How Necessary Labour-Time Is Shortened

Necessary labour-time is the time required for the worker to produce the equivalent of his own means of subsistence. Its length is determined by the **value of labour-power**, which in turn is determined by the value of the commodities the worker needs to survive.

Therefore, to shorten necessary labour-time, the value of these wage-goods must be reduced. And the value of commodities can only be reduced by increasing the **productivity of labour** in the industries that produce them.

- If it takes less labour-time to produce the same quantity of food, clothing, and housing, then the value of those goods falls.
- If the value of the worker's means of subsistence falls, the value of labour-power falls.
- If the value of labour-power falls, the necessary labour-time shrinks, and surplus labour-time expands proportionally.

This is the mechanism of relative surplus-value. The capitalist does not directly force the worker to work longer hours; instead, he revolutionizes the *production process* to make the necessities of life cheaper, thereby increasing the portion of the day from which he profits.

#### A Crucial Distinction

Marx emphasizes that the production of relative surplus-value revolutionizes the **technical and social conditions of the labour process**—the mode of production itself. It is not about working longer, but about working *differently*, more productively.

When productivity increases *only in a particular branch of industry*, the individual capitalist who innovates gains a temporary advantage. He can sell his commodities below their social value (but above their individual cost) and pocket an extra surplus-value. However, this is a transient phenomenon. Once the new method becomes general, the advantage disappears, and all that remains is a permanently lower value for the commodity and a permanently higher general rate of surplus-value.

#### Relative Surplus-Value as a Driving Force of Capitalist Development

The drive for relative surplus-value is the engine of technological and organizational change under capitalism. It compels each capitalist to constantly revolutionize production to stay ahead of competitors. This creates a dynamic, restless system where nothing remains stable.

- In **manufacture**, this drive leads to the detailed division of labour and the specialization of workers and tools.
- In **large-scale industry**, it leads to the substitution of machinery for living labour and the application of science to production.

The remaining chapters of Part Four will trace this historical and logical development, showing how capital progressively subordinates labour not just by extending the working day, but by transforming the very nature of work itself.

In summary, Chapter 12 introduces the concept of relative surplus-value as the distinctively *capitalist* method of increasing exploitation. Unlike the crude extension of the working day, relative surplus-value works through increasing productivity, cheapening commodities, and revolutionizing the entire mode of production. It reveals capital's drive not just to extract more labour, but to reshape the world in its own image.
