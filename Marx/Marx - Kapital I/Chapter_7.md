This chapter marks a major turning point. Having identified labour-power as the unique commodity that can create value, Marx now takes the reader into the "hidden abode of production" to analyze what actually happens when the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased. The chapter is divided into two parts: the labour process in general, and the specifically capitalist valorization process.

#### 1. The Labour Process

Marx begins by examining the labour process as a universal condition of human existence, independent of any specific social form.

- **Labour as a Metabolic Interaction:** Labour is, first of all, a process between man and nature. Through his own activity, man mediates, regulates, and controls the "metabolism" (*Stoffwechsel*) between himself and nature. He confronts nature as a natural force, setting in motion his own bodily powers to appropriate nature's materials in a form adapted to his own needs. In acting on external nature, he simultaneously changes his own nature.
- **Distinctly Human Labour:** What distinguishes the worst architect from the best bee is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before constructing it in reality. The result of labour exists *ideally* before it exists materially. Labour is purposeful activity, requiring the subordination of the worker's will.
- **Simple Elements of the Labour Process:** Marx identifies three elementary factors:
    1.  **Purposeful activity (work itself):** The productive activity of the worker.
    2.  **The object of labour:** The thing on which work is performed. This can be spontaneously provided by nature (fish, timber from a virgin forest) or, if it has already been filtered through previous labour, it is called **raw material**.
    3.  **The instruments of labour:** Things the worker interposes between himself and the object of labour (tools, machines, etc.). These serve as conductors of his activity. In a wider sense, this also includes all objective conditions necessary for the process (workshops, canals, roads). The instruments of labour are crucial for distinguishing different economic epochs.
- **Product and Means of Production:** The labour process is extinguished in the **product**. Labour has been objectified. The instruments and object of labour become **means of production**, and labour itself is **productive labour** (from the standpoint of the simple labour process). Products are not only results but also conditions of labour; they enter into new labour processes as means of production.
- **Productive Consumption:** The labour process is a process of consumption—**productive consumption**—where means of production are used up to create new products, as distinct from individual consumption which uses up products to sustain the individual.

#### 2. The Valorization Process

Marx now examines the same production process, but this time from the perspective of the capitalist, whose aim is not just to produce a use-value but a commodity with value, and more specifically, surplus-value.

- **The Process of Creating Value:** The capitalist buys means of production and labour-power at their values. The worker's labour adds new value to the product. But it also *preserves* the value of the means of production, transferring it to the new product. This dual result stems from the dual nature of labour:
    - As **abstract labour**, it creates *new value*.
    - As **concrete, useful labour**, it *preserves and transfers* the value of the means of production.
- **The Value of the Product:** If the worker works only long enough to reproduce the value of his own labour-power (say, 6 hours), the value of the product exactly equals the capital advanced (means of production + wages). No surplus-value is created. Money has not been transformed into capital.
- **The Secret of Surplus-Value:** But the capitalist has bought a *day's* labour-power, not just the hours needed to replace its value. He can make the worker continue labouring beyond this necessary point.
    - Suppose the necessary labour-time is 6 hours, but the capitalist makes the worker labour for 12 hours.
    - In those extra 6 hours, the worker continues to create value, but this value no longer goes to replace his wages. It is **surplus labour**, and its objectified form is **surplus-value**.
    - The value of the product is now greater than the value of the capital advanced. Money has been successfully transformed into capital.

- **The Unity of the Two Processes:** The production process, considered as:
    - The unity of the labour process and the *value-creating process*, is the process of producing *commodities*.
    - The unity of the labour process and the *valorization process* (value-creating process continued beyond a certain point), is the **capitalist process of production**, or the capitalist form of commodity production.

In essence, the "trick" has worked. The capitalist has respected all the laws of commodity exchange—buying labour-power at its value, buying means of production at their value, and selling the product at its value—yet he ends up with more value than he started with. The source of this surplus-value is the difference between the value of labour-power and the value it can create when consumed. The worker's labour-power, for the capitalist, is a source of more value than it has itself.
