# Summary of Chapter 1: Introduction: Management and Managers Defined

## Key Concepts

**Management as Innovation**
- Management is arguably the 20th century's most important innovation
- Our society has become a "knowledge society," a "society of organizations," and a "networked society"
- Major social tasks are now performed through organized institutions managed by professional managers

**What Is Management?**
- Management is the specific organ of every institution—what holds it together and makes it work
- When an organization grows beyond 300-1,000 employees or reaches a certain complexity, it must shift from owner-entrepreneur control to professional management
- Management precedes and outranks ownership—owners must subordinate themselves to the enterprise's need for management

**Who Are Managers?**
- Traditional definition: someone "responsible for the work of other people" is inadequate
- Modern definition: managers are those who take **responsibility for contribution** to organizational results, regardless of whether they supervise others
- Individual professional contributors (market researchers, senior accountants, etc.) are part of management because they impact organizational performance

**What Do Managers Do?** (Five Basic Operations)
1. **Set objectives** - Determine goals, decide what needs to be done to reach them, communicate objectives effectively
2. **Organize** - Analyze activities, decisions, and relationships; classify work; structure jobs; select people for positions
3. **Motivate and communicate** - Build teams through people decisions, pay, placement, promotion, and constant communication
4. **Measure** - Establish targets and yardsticks; analyze, appraise, and interpret performance
5. **Develop people** - Including themselves (increasingly important in the knowledge age)

**The Manager's Resource: People**
- Working with people means developing them
- Requires integrity of character above all—more important than likability, brilliance, or technical competence
- Managers without integrity, no matter how competent, are unfit to be managers

**Management as Practice, Not Science**
- Management contains scientific elements but is ultimately a practice—like medicine, law, or engineering
- It's about performance and achievement, not just knowledge
- Managers practice management, not economics, behavioral science, or quantification (though these are tools)
- The ultimate test is performance, not credentials or degrees

**Historical Roots**
- Early economists (Smith, Marx) didn't recognize management
- French economist J.B. Say coined "entrepreneur"
- Large-scale organizations emerged around 1870 (railroads, universal banks)
- Key contributors: Taylor (work study), Fayol (organization structure), Sloan (decentralization)
