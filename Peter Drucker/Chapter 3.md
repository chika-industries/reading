# Summary of Chapter 3: The Dimensions of Management

## Key Concepts

**Management's Three Core Tasks**
Every institution faces three tasks—equally important but essentially different:

1. **Define the specific purpose and mission** – Why the institution exists
2. **Make work productive and the worker achieving** – The human dimension
3. **Manage social impacts and social responsibilities** – The institution's relationship to society

## First Dimension: Mission and Economic Performance

**For Business Enterprises Only**
- Economic performance is the *specific* mission of business—its rationale and purpose
- In all other institutions (hospitals, churches, universities), economics is a *restraint* (the budget sets limits)
- Business management must put economic performance first in every decision and action
- A business fails if it doesn't produce economic results: goods/services customers want, maintaining or improving wealth-producing capacity

**Management Is Not Passive**
- Early economists saw businessmen as purely adaptive—responding to external forces
- Modern view: management shapes the economic environment, plans and initiates changes, pushes back limitations
- Management is both creature and creator of the economy
- "To manage a business means to manage by objectives"

## Second Dimension: Productive Work and Worker Achievement

**People as the Only True Resource**
- Enterprises have only one real resource: *people*
- Organizations perform by making human resources productive
- Work must be organized according to its own logic—but workers follow human logic, which is radically different

**Human Resources Can Grow**
- All other resources (machines, capital) can only be better or worse utilized
- Only human beings can grow and develop
- Their output can be greater than the sum of inputs—but only through directed, focused, united effort

**The Management Misconception**
- We traditionally treat rank-and-file workers as material resources—doing as directed without responsibility
- This is a serious error: rank-and-file jobs are *potentially* managerial and would be more productive if made so
- Organization structure is about managers and their functions, not workers
- Leadership and spirit are made by the management group
- When enterprises fail, we hire new presidents, not new workers

## Third Dimension: Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities

**Institutions Exist for Society**
- No institution exists as an end in itself—every one is an organ of society
- Business exists to supply goods/services to customers and economic surplus to society
- Jobs and dividends are necessary means, not ends
- Hospitals exist for patients, schools for students—forgetting this is mismanagement

**Inevitable Impacts**
- To do its job, enterprise must have impacts on people, communities, society
- It has power and authority over employees
- It affects communities as neighbor, source of jobs and taxes, producer of waste
- Must increasingly concern itself with quality of life—physical, human, social environment

## Which Task Is Most Important?

**All Three Must Be Managed Simultaneously**
- Economic performance comes first (reason for existence)—but if work and workers are mismanaged, no economic performance
- Economic performance achieved by mismanaging work is illusory and destructive of capital
- Mismanaging social impacts destroys society's support for the enterprise—and with it the enterprise

**Each Has Its Own Primacy**
- Managing the business: primacy because enterprise is an economic institution
- Making work productive and workers achieving: primacy because society looks to management for realization of basic beliefs and values
- Managing social impacts: primacy because no organ can survive the body it serves

## The Time Dimension

**Always Both Present and Future**
- Every management problem, decision, action must consider both short run and long run
- A problem isn't solved if immediate profits endanger long-term survival
- Decisions are irresponsible if they risk disaster this year for a grandiose future

**Why Time Is Difficult**
1. **Longer time spans** – Technological progress lengthens fruition time (Edison: 2 years; today: 15 years)
2. **Living in both present and future simultaneously** – Must keep enterprise performing today while building capacity for tomorrow

**The Future Is Discontinuity**
- For managers, the future means discontinuity—but can only be reached from the present
- The greater the leap into the unknown, the stronger the foundation must be

## Administration and Entrepreneurship

**Managers Must Do Both**
- **Administer**: Manage and improve what already exists; optimize yield from existing resources (efficiency)
- **Be entrepreneurs**: Redirect resources from low-performing to high-performing areas; slough off yesterday; create tomorrow (effectiveness)

**Efficiency vs. Effectiveness**
- **Efficiency**: Doing things right—concerned with costs and input of effort
- **Effectiveness**: Doing the right things—focused on opportunities, revenue, markets, extraordinary results
- No amount of efficiency saves a business doing the wrong things (buggy whip manufacturers)
- Effectiveness is the foundation of success; efficiency is a minimum condition for survival after success

**The 80/20 Reality**
- In any social organism, 10-15% of phenomena (products, customers, markets) produce 80-90% of results
- The other 85-90% produce nothing but costs, no matter how efficiently managed
- First administrative job: make effective the small core of worthwhile activities; neutralize or abandon the rest

**Entrepreneurship Means Making Tomorrow's Business**
- Requires systematic analysis and hard work today
- Cannot rely on "flash of genius"
- Perpetuation of the business beyond a single generation is the central entrepreneurial task—the definitive test of management
