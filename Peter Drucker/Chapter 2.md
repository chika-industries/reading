# Summary of Chapter 2: Management as a Social Function and Liberal Art

## Key Concepts

**Management's Transformative Impact**
- In less than 150 years, management has transformed the social and economic fabric of developed countries
- Created a global economy and set new rules for participation
- Converted the workforce from unskilled laborers to highly educated knowledge workers
- No earlier society could employ large numbers of knowledgeable people productively—management made this possible

**Management as Agent of Transformation**
- Modern businesses employ up to 10,000 knowledge workers across 60 different knowledge areas
- Without managed enterprises, specialized knowledge produces nothing
- Management has converted knowledge from "social ornament and luxury into the true capital of any economy"
- The command-and-control military model dominated for nearly 100 years but began changing as specialized knowledge entered enterprises

**Key Historical Developments**
- First university-trained engineer hired by Siemens in 1867; within five years, a research department existed
- Application of management to manual work through training (scientific management) allowed low-wage countries to become efficient competitors
- Decentralization, modern accounting, planning, and marketing emerged in 1920s-1930s
- Allies won World War II through management—outproducing enemies despite fewer resources

**Management Is Not Just Business Management**
- Applies to all institutions: hospitals, universities, churches, arts organizations, social-service agencies
- Nonprofits have grown faster than business or government since WWII
- Though fundraising and volunteer management differ, core responsibilities are the same: strategy, goals, people development, performance measurement, marketing

**Management and Entrepreneurship**
- False dichotomy: they are not adversaries but complementary
- Existing organizations decline without innovation; new ventures collapse without management
- Both are always needed simultaneously
- Innovation applies to existing organizations; management applies to new ventures

**Accountability of Management**
- To whom is management accountable? For what?
- Pension funds now control publicly owned companies—they are legally "owners" but economically "investors"
- The takeover movement assumes enterprise's sole function is immediate shareholder gain
- Management must be accountable for performance, but how to define and measure performance remains a challenge
- Managers have not faced up to the fact that they represent power—and power must be legitimate and accountable

**Seven Principles of Management**
1. **About human beings** - Task is to make people capable of joint performance, making strengths effective and weaknesses irrelevant
2. **Embedded in culture** - What managers do is the same globally; *how* they do it differs by culture
3. **Requires common goals and shared values** - Simple, clear, unifying objectives; mission must provide common vision
4. **Must enable growth and development** - Every enterprise is a learning and teaching institution
5. **Built on communication and individual responsibility** - Members must think through what they aim to accomplish and what they owe others
6. **Requires multiple measurements** - Market standing, innovation, productivity, people development, quality, financial results—all crucial
7. **Results exist only on the outside** - Satisfied customer, healed patient, student who learns

**Management as Liberal Art**
- Deals with action and application (technology) AND with people, values, growth (humanity)
- Concerned with spiritual matters—nature of man, good and evil
- "Liberal" because it deals with fundamentals of knowledge, self-knowledge, wisdom, leadership
- "Art" because it is practice and application
- Draws on humanities and social sciences but focuses knowledge on effectiveness and results
- Management will increasingly be the discipline through which the humanities regain relevance and impact
