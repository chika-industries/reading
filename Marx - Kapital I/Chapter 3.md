### Summary of Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities

In this lengthy and detailed chapter, Marx moves from the abstract concept of money as the universal equivalent to its concrete functions in the real world of commodity exchange. He analyzes the various roles money plays, showing how each function develops logically from the contradictions within the circulation process itself. The chapter is divided into three main sections: Money as the Measure of Value, as the Means of Circulation, and as Money in the full sense (which includes hoarding, means of payment, and world money).

#### 1. The Measure of Values

- **Function:** Money's first and primary function is to act as the universal measure of value. It provides the material for the expression of the values of all other commodities, converting them into prices (i.e., a definite quantity of the money commodity).
- **Gold as the Standard:** For simplicity, Marx assumes gold is the money commodity. Gold serves as the measure of value because it is itself a commodity, a product of labour. Commodities are commensurable not *because of* money, but *because* they are all objectified human labour; money simply becomes the form in which their common measure (labour-time) appears.
- **Ideal Money:** In this function, money serves only in an imaginary or ideal capacity. A commodity-owner can set a price for his goods without a single grain of real gold being present. However, this ideal function still depends on the real substance of money; the price of a commodity in gold is entirely different from its price in silver.
- **Price and Value:** Price is the money-name of the labour objectified in a commodity. However, Marx introduces a crucial distinction: **price and magnitude of value are not necessarily identical.** The price-form inherently allows for a quantitative incongruity. A commodity can be sold above or below its value, and this divergence is not a defect but the adequate form for a mode of production where laws assert themselves through constant irregularities. Even more, a price can exist without any value at all (e.g., for conscience, honour, or uncultivated land).

#### 2. The Means of Circulation

This section analyzes the actual movement of commodities and money in exchange.

- **A. The Metamorphosis of Commodities:** The exchange process is not a simple swap of goods but a social metabolism mediated by a change in form. This is the circuit **Commodity-Money-Commodity (C-M-C)**.
    - **First Metamorphosis (C-M):** The *sale*. The commodity owner turns his commodity into money. This is a "salto mortale," a perilous leap for the commodity. If it fails to sell, the owner is ruined. The success of this leap depends on whether the private labour embodied in the commodity is recognized as socially useful labour.
    - **Second Metamorphosis (M-C):** The *purchase*. The money-owner now uses the money to buy another commodity. Money is the "absolutely alienable" commodity, the universal equivalent that can purchase anything.
    - **The Unity and Separation of Sale and Purchase:** C-M-C is a single circuit, but it is composed of two independent and opposite acts. This is a key point. The identity of sale and purchase means that for the commodity owner, the process can be interrupted. One can sell without immediately buying. This split, which overcomes the limitations of direct barter, also creates the **abstract possibility of commercial crises**. An internal unity (the need to exchange) now moves through external antitheses (sale and purchase as separate acts).

- **B. The Circulation of Money:** This section examines the movement of money as a medium of circulation.
    - **The Path of Money:** Unlike the commodity, which falls out of circulation into consumption, money "haunts the sphere of circulation" and constantly moves around within it.
    - **Quantity of Money in Circulation:** Marx establishes the fundamental law that, given the value of money, **the quantity of money in circulation is determined by the sum of the prices of all commodities in circulation and the average velocity of circulation of money.** (Quantity of money = Sum of Commodity Prices / Velocity of Circulation). This refutes the "quantity theory of money" which argued the reverse—that prices are determined by the amount of money in circulation.

- **C. Coin and The Symbol of Value:** As a medium of circulation, money takes the form of coin.
    - **Wear and Tear:** In the process of circulation, coins physically wear down, causing their nominal content to diverge from their real content. This fact implies that metallic money can be replaced by tokens or symbols.
    - **Paper Money:** Marx distinguishes between state-issued inconvertible paper money and credit-money. State paper money with "forced currency" can only function as a substitute for gold coins within a country. Its value is purely representative; its quantity must be limited to the amount of gold coins that would otherwise circulate. If too much paper money is issued, it will simply depreciate, and prices will rise accordingly.

#### 3. Money

Having served as a measure of value and a medium of circulation, money now takes on more complex functions as "money proper," where it becomes an end in itself.

- **A. Hoarding:** When the circuit C-M-C is interrupted, and the sale is not followed by a purchase, money is immobilized and becomes a hoard. This is the "first metamorphosis" of the commodity becoming an end in itself. The drive to hoard is boundless, as money qualitatively represents unlimited wealth, but each actual sum is quantitatively limited. This contradiction fuels the endless accumulation of the miser. Hoarding also serves an essential economic function in a metallic currency system: the hoards act as reservoirs or channels, automatically absorbing surplus money from circulation and releasing money when it is needed, thus regulating the actual amount in circulation.

- **B. Means of Payment:** With the development of circulation, commodities are not always sold for immediate cash. Conditions arise (different production times, different locations) where the sale and the payment are separated in time. The seller becomes a creditor, the buyer a debtor. Money now functions as a **means of payment**.
    - **New Contradiction:** The buyer purchases before paying. This creates a new set of social relations. When payments are due, money steps in to settle the account, no longer as a mere intermediary but as the "individual incarnation of social labour." This function leads to the development of credit-money.
    - **Monetary Crisis:** The contradiction within money's role as a means of payment erupts in a crisis. When a chain of payments is disrupted by a failure to pay at one point, money suddenly transforms from a nominal, ideal measure into the one thing everyone needs: "hard cash." This is the moment when the antithesis between commodity and value-form becomes absolute.

- **C. World Money:** When money leaves the domestic sphere of circulation and enters international trade, it must shed its local forms (coin, small change, symbols of value). It returns to its original form: **precious metal in the shape of bullion**. In the world market, money functions fully as the universal equivalent, the commodity whose natural form is also the directly social form of realization of human labour in the abstract. It serves as the universal means of payment (to settle international balances), the universal means of purchase, and the universal embodiment of wealth.

In summary, Marx shows that money is not a mere convenience but a necessary product of commodity exchange. Its various functions—measure, circulating medium, hoard, means of payment, and world money—are all different forms of the single social relation of value, each expressing a more developed stage of contradiction within the circulation process.
