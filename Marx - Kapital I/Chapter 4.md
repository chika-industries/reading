Here is a summary of Chapter 4 of *Capital*, Volume 1.

### Summary of Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital

Having established the nature of commodities, money, and circulation, Marx now turns to the transformation of money into capital. This chapter introduces the first general form in which capital appears and poses the central question that the rest of the volume will answer: where does surplus-value come from?

#### The Starting Point: Money

Marx argues that the circulation of commodities is the historical starting-point of capital. World trade and the world market, emerging in the sixteenth century, create the conditions for capital to arise. In its first form of appearance, capital is always money—money intended to be transformed into capital. The difference between money as money and money as capital lies in their different **forms of circulation**.

#### Two Distinct Circuits

Marx contrasts two circuits:

1.  **The Simple Circulation of Commodities:** C-M-C (Commodity-Money-Commodity). This is selling in order to buy. A producer sells a commodity to get money, and then uses that money to buy a different commodity. The goal of this process is the final commodity, a **use-value** to satisfy a need. The movement begins and ends with commodities, and money is merely a mediator.

2.  **The Circulation of Capital:** M-C-M (Money-Commodity-Money). This is buying in order to sell. A capitalist starts with money, buys a commodity, and then sells that commodity to get money back. The goal is not use-value but **exchange-value itself**. The movement begins and ends with money, and the commodity is merely a mediator.

#### The Drive for Surplus-Value

At first glance, M-C-M seems absurd and tautological—exchanging money for money. But Marx points out that the process only makes sense if the amount of money at the end is greater than the amount at the start. The circuit is therefore more accurately represented as **M-C-M'** , where **M' = M + ΔM**. This increment, this excess over the original value, Marx calls **surplus-value**.

The process of "buying in order to sell dearer" is what converts money into capital. The value originally advanced not only remains intact in circulation but also expands, adds a surplus-value to itself. It is "valorized" (*verwertet*).

#### Capital as Endless Movement

Unlike C-M-C, which finds its goal in a final use-value outside of circulation, M-C-M' has no inherent end. The goal is the ceaseless expansion of value. A capitalist who ends with £110 is not satisfied; that sum is now the new starting point for a further cycle of valorization. **The movement of capital is therefore limitless.**

Marx contrasts the capitalist with the miser. The miser also desires the accumulation of money, but he seeks to achieve it by *withdrawing* money from circulation (hoarding). The capitalist, in contrast, achieves it by constantly *throwing* money back into circulation to extract more. The capitalist is the "rational miser."

#### Value as an Automatic Subject

In the M-C-M' circuit, value becomes the subject of a process. It takes the form of money and commodities, but it preserves and expands itself through these changes. It becomes "value in process," an "automatic subject." It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value, like a father and son who are ultimately one.

This movement, where money begets more money, is the general formula for capital in its pure form as it appears in the sphere of circulation. It applies not only to **merchants' capital** (buying to sell dearer) but also to **industrial capital** (where production occurs between purchase and sale) and, in its most abridged form, to **interest-bearing capital** (M-M', money that breeds money without any intermediary).

In short, Chapter 4 establishes the defining characteristic of capital: it is self-expanding value, value that enters circulation with the sole purpose of returning as more value, in an endless and boundless drive. The chapter sets the problem for the next two chapters: if all exchange in the sphere of circulation is supposed to be an exchange of equivalents, where does this surplus-value come from?
