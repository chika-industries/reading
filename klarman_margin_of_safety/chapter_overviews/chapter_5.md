Here is a summary of **Chapter 5: "Defining Your Investment Goals"** .

In this concise but crucial chapter, Seth Klarman establishes the foundational principle upon which his entire investment philosophy is built: **the primary goal of investing should be the avoidance of loss, not the pursuit of gain.**

### 1. The First Rule: Don't Lose Money
Klarman opens by quoting Warren Buffett: the first rule of investing is "Don't lose money," and the second rule is "Never forget the first rule."
- He acknowledges that this sounds obvious, but observes that most investor behavior contradicts it. The speculative urge to chase quick profits (a "free lunch") is incredibly powerful, especially when others seem to be getting rich.
- A loss-avoidance strategy is at odds with the conventional wisdom that "stocks always go up over time" or that one must be "fully invested." Klarman warns that if everyone believes stocks offer the best returns, they will bid prices up so high that the risk of loss actually becomes substantial.

### 2. The Math of Compounding
Klarman provides a mathematical rationale for focusing on loss avoidance: the magic of compounding works best when losses are avoided.
- A 50% loss requires a 100% gain just to get back to even. One large loss can wipe out years of careful compounding.
- He demonstrates that consistent, moderate returns with low risk will make you richer over time than volatile, high returns punctuated by a single bad year. An investor earning 16% annually for ten years ends up with more money than an investor who earns 20% for nine years but loses 15% in the tenth.

### 3. The Unpredictability of the Future
Because the future is unpredictable, investors must position themselves to survive under *any* circumstance.
- Just as you buy flood insurance even if a flood only happens once a century, investors must be willing to sacrifice some near-term return as an "insurance premium" against unexpected adversity.
- This does not mean hoarding cash or gold, but rather constructing a portfolio that acknowledges that the world can change dramatically and unexpectedly.

### 4. The Futility of Targeting Returns
Klarman argues that setting a specific return goal (e.g., "I want to make 15% a year") is a mistake.
- Investment returns are not like a salary; you cannot work overtime to achieve them. The market offers what it offers.
- Targeting a return forces investors to focus on the **upside** to meet their goal, causing them to ignore the **downside risk**. To chase a high target, they may take on dangerous risks.
- Instead of focusing on return, investors should focus on **risk**. They should compare every potential investment against the "risk-free" alternative (Treasury bills). If an investment carries risk, it should only be made if it promises a return *considerably higher* than the risk-free rate.

**Conclusion:** Klarman states that most investment approaches do not focus on loss avoidance. Only one that he knows of does: **value investing**. This sets the stage for the chapters that follow, which will explain the philosophy and mechanics of the value approach.
