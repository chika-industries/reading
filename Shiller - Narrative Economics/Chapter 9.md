# Summary of Chapter 9: Recurrence and Mutation

In this opening chapter of Part III, Shiller introduces the concept of **perennial economic narratives**—stories that never completely disappear but repeatedly resurface in mutated forms, influencing economic behavior across generations.

## The Nature of Perennial Narratives

Just as disease epidemics recur when viruses mutate to overcome acquired immunity, economic narratives recur with mutations that refresh their contagion. The 1918 flu pandemic mirrored the trajectory of the Great Depression—except narratives, not viruses, carried the "disease" of economic downturn.

**Mutation mechanisms**:
- Different celebrity attached (William Jennings Bryan for bimetallism, Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin)
- New visual images
- New punch lines
- Changed political or social context
- Connection to other currently contagious narratives

The next new money narrative will have yet another celebrity's name. Just as Bryan is mostly forgotten today, Nakamoto will likely be forgotten in the future—but the narrative pattern persists.

## From Fear to Opportunity

A narrative can mutate from creating fear to creating opportunity. The **labor-saving machines narrative** generated fear during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the same basic story mutated to create a sense of opportunity during the **dot-com boom of the 1990s**. The words may appear in searches across decades, but their economic interpretation changes dramatically.

**Latent fears**: A narrative may inspire fear that technology will someday replace jobs, but the economic effects may not appear until years later when some other narrative or news creates a sense that the feared replacement is imminent.

## The International Scope of Recurrent Narratives

Recurrent narratives tend to be **international**—partly because news media observe foreign countries, recognizing that what's viral in one country can often be made contagious in another. Like disease epidemics, narrative epidemics are stronger in some countries than others at any given time, and more similar in countries sharing language or borders.

Shiller notes that his examples come mostly from the United States—the country he knows best, and one with well-documented business cycle history dating to 1854 through the **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)** .

## Surprising Continuity Across Centuries

Despite profound institutional changes over 50, 100, or 150 years, the events and reactions of the past are **surprisingly similar** to what we see today. Today's narratives echo historical periods.

**Example**: The story about the huckster who offers a coin toss bet with "Heads I win, tails you lose"—and the sucker who takes it—has circulated since at least 1847. Back then, it was sometimes attached to stories of the Whig Party, President Zachary Taylor, or free-market advocate Richard Cobden—names few remember today. The themes persist even as the characters change.

## Major US Economic Events Since 1854

Shiller lists the biggest economic events in US history as defined by the NBER—events that will appear frequently in subsequent chapters:

1. **Depression of 1857-59**, followed by southern secession (1860-61) and the **Civil War** (1861-65)—the most lethal war in US history

2. **Depression of 1873-79**, leading to Henry George's *Progress and Poverty* (1879)—the best-selling economics book in US history—which accused free markets of producing worsening inequality

3. **Depression of the 1890s** (two NBER contractions: 1893-94 and 1895-97). Unemployment exceeded 8% from 1893 to 1899, coinciding with the Spanish-American War and Philippine War

4. **Three short contractions from 1907 to 1914**, starting with the Panic of 1907, which led to the Federal Reserve System's creation, followed by World War I (beginning 1914)

5. **Brief but extreme depression of 1920-21**—the sharpest deflation in US history

6. **The Great Depression** after the 1929 crash—worldwide, running from 1930 to 1941 with unemployment over 8%. Named by Lionel Robbins's 1934 book, it comprised two NBER contractions (1929-33 and 1937-38) and immediately preceded World War II

7. **Severe recession of 1973-75**—Otto Eckstein called it the "Great Recession" in his 1978 book, inviting comparison with the Great Depression

8. **Severe recession of 1980-82** (two NBER contractions)—also called the "Great Recession" at the time, again inviting Great Depression comparisons

9. **Severe recession of 2007-9**—named the "Great Recession" once more, and this time the name truly went viral and has stuck

## Depressions as Narratives Themselves

These recessions and depressions are **narratives in themselves**, active in producing subsequent events. Economic downturns tend to evoke memories of the last large downturn—especially the **record-holder**, which in the US and much of the world is the Great Depression.

Economic historians typically list contemporary events as causes: bank failures, strikes, gold discoveries, crop failures. Such information is useful, but Shiller's goal is to consider these events through the lens of the prominent narratives and narrative constellations that likely helped bring them about or increase their severity.

## The Nine Perennial Narratives

Part III will examine **nine perennial narrative constellations** (some presented as opposing pairs):

1. **Panic versus confidence**—stories about others' confidence and efforts to promote public confidence
2. **Frugality versus conspicuous consumption**—modest living versus displays of success
3. **Gold standard versus bimetallism**—narratives about monetary systems and their moral dimensions
4. **Labor-saving machines replace many jobs**—fears dating to the Industrial Revolution
5. **Automation and artificial intelligence replace almost all jobs**—the mutated modern version
6. **Real estate booms and busts**—stories about land, housing, and location value
7. **Stock market bubbles**—excitement, risk-taking, and social comparison among investors
8. **Boycotts, profiteers, and evil business**—anger at business during inflationary periods
9. **The wage-price spiral and evil labor unions**—blame for inflation falling on both labor and management

## Key Insight

These chapters are organized **thematically, not chronologically**, because the themes remain relevant beyond specific historical moments. The goal is to extract common patterns that will help recognize and anticipate the effects of **future economic narratives**—stories that haven't yet been written but will inevitably emerge in new mutations, attached to new celebrities, responding to new circumstances, yet following the same fundamental dynamics that have shaped economic behavior for centuries.
