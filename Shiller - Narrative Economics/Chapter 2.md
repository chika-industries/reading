# Summary of Chapter 2: An Adventure in Consilience

In this chapter, Shiller introduces the concept of **consilience**—the unity of knowledge across academic disciplines—and argues that understanding economic narratives requires drawing insights from diverse fields.

## The Concept of Consilience

Coined by philosopher William Whewell in 1840 and popularized by biologist E.O. Wilson in 1994, consilience refers to bringing together knowledge from different disciplines. Since the economy consists of conscious human beings whose actions are shaped by stories, emotions, and ideas, understanding economic narratives requires perspectives from across the university.

## Economics Lags Behind

Shiller presents striking evidence that **economics and finance lag behind other disciplines** in attending to narratives:

- A graph (Figure 2.1) shows that across all academic fields, articles containing the word "narrative" increased significantly between 2010-2019 compared to earlier years
- However, economics and finance have the lowest percentages among all disciplines
- When economists do use the word, it's usually casually or tangentially, rarely documenting a narrative's popularity or tracing its economic impact

## Insights from Other Fields

Shiller surveys how different disciplines approach narrative:

**Epidemiology**: Offers sophisticated mathematical models of disease spread that can be adapted to study how economic narratives spread through populations. This field provides the foundation for the epidemic models used throughout the book.

**History**: Historians like Ramsay MacMullen emphasize understanding what was on people's minds—the "terms and images that energize." Douglass North similarly stressed the importance of human intentionality (narratives) in economic institutional development.

**Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology**: These fields have developed "narrative psychology," "storytelling sociology," and studies of how personal stories reveal values. Anthropologists note that investment firms tell "creation myths" about their founders, similar to tribal origin stories.

**Literary Studies**: Literary theorists have identified recurring story structures—basic plots that appear repeatedly across cultures. Scholars like Christopher Booker argue there are only seven basic plots (rags to riches, quest, tragedy, etc.), suggesting the human brain may have built-in receptors for certain story patterns.

**Neuroscience and Neurolinguistics**: Research shows that metaphors activate consistent brain regions. The human brain seems "wired" to respond to stories and think in analogies. When we hear "stock market crash," we're unconsciously reminded of 1929 narratives.

## The Promise of Collaboration

Shiller concludes that collaborative research between economists and experts from these diverse fields—especially epidemiologists—holds tremendous promise for revolutionizing economics and improving our ability to forecast major economic events.
