# Summary of Chapter 4: Why Do Some Narratives Go Viral?

In this chapter, Shiller explores the elusive question of why certain narratives become epidemics while most fade into obscurity, drawing on insights from philosophy, anthropology, neuroscience, and experimental social science.

## The Spontaneity of Narratives

Shiller opens with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's observation that "a man is always a teller of tales"—we live surrounded by stories and see everything through them. This storytelling instinct is so fundamental that it appears in our dreams, which neuroscientists describe as having characters, settings, and event structures.

**Dreaming and brain damage**: Brain lesions can lead to spontaneous confabulation, suggesting narrative is hardwired into our neural architecture. The brain's activity during dreaming resembles that of damaged brains that fabricate stories without conscious control.

## Social Movements and Viral Stories

The 1960s **sit-in movement** illustrates how a single narrative can spark nationwide change:

- On February 1, 1960, four Black students in Greensboro, North Carolina, sat patiently at a segregated lunch counter and refused to leave
- The story spread through word of mouth and news media
- Within weeks, sit-ins erupted across the United States
- The word "sit-in" itself followed an epidemic curve, peaking around 1970

Sociologist Francesca Polletta notes that while activists helped promulgate the story, they couldn't control it—the movement was "like a fever," largely viral and spontaneous.

**Earlier example**: Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852) sold over a million copies when the US population was much smaller. The novel spawned songs ("Eliza's Flight") and plays ("Tom shows") that spread the antislavery narrative far beyond the book's readers, contributing to the political climate that led to the Civil War.

## Universality of Narrative

Anthropologist Donald Brown identified narrative as a **human universal**—found in every society. Some scholars suggest our species should be called *Homo narrans* (storytelling man) rather than *Homo sapiens* (wise man). Unlike animals, which transmit culture through observation, humans use language to convey stories independent of direct experience.

**Ancient recognition**: Plato worried about stories' power, arguing in *The Republic* that certain narratives should be censored because they might make guardians "too excitable and effeminate." Cicero noted that nature "produces men to be facetious mimics or storytellers."

## Conspiracy Theories

Popular narratives often have an **"us versus them"** theme. Historian Richard Hofstadter observed that conspiracy theories show "touching concern with factuality" despite often being absurd. This tendency may relate to human patterns of reciprocity and vengeance—important for economic behavior like willingness to punish unfairness even at personal cost.

## Scripts and Social Norms

Psychologists Schank and Abelson argue that narratives function as **scripts**—social norms that govern behavior. The "prudent person rule" in finance requires fiduciaries to follow a script rather than exercise independent judgment.

**The rolling suitcase puzzle**: Shiller offers a fascinating case study of why good ideas sometimes fail to catch on. Wheeled suitcases were patented as early as 1887 and repeatedly invented, but didn't become popular until the 1990s. Why? The earlier versions used leather straps and tended to flop over. But more importantly, they lacked the right narrative. When Northwest Airlines pilot Robert Plath invented the **Rollaboard** in 1991—with wheels and a retractable handle—flight crews adopted it first. Passengers saw these glamorous pilots gliding effortlessly through airports, and the narrative finally went viral.

## Experimental Evidence

Sociologist Matthew Salganik's **"artificial music market" experiment** provides powerful evidence for how narratives spread:

- Subjects could listen to and download songs by unknown bands
- In the "independent" condition, subjects saw no information about others' choices
- In the "shared" condition, subjects were divided into eight separate "worlds" where they could see download counts

**Results**: Each world developed its own unique set of hits, only weakly correlated across worlds. Inequality of success was much higher than in the independent condition. Random initial choices got amplified over time, creating different "stars" in each world.

## Key Insight

History is not a logically ordered sequence of events but is shaped by **random small beginnings**—seemingly irrelevant mutations in narratives that have slightly higher contagion rates or first-mover advantages. These random events can feed back into larger narrative constellations, ultimately shaping economic outcomes in ways that later stories try to make sense of through tidy explanations.

The lesson: major economic events often result from **randomness amplified by social feedback**, not from deterministic forces that could have been predicted in advance.
