# Summary of Chapter 6: Diverse Evidence on the Virality of Economic Narratives

In this chapter, Shiller assembles evidence from multiple disciplines—neuroscience, history, marketing, psychology, and evolutionary biology—to explain why certain narratives become contagious and influence economic behavior.

## The Brain's Narrative Impulse

**Penfield's discoveries**: In the 1950s, brain surgeon Wilder Penfield electrically stimulated specific brain regions during surgery on awake patients. When he touched certain spots, patients heard music in chronological order—the same piece starting at the same point each time. Stimulating other areas caused patients to relive stories sequentially. This suggests the brain has dedicated structures for storing and retrieving narratives.

**Modern neuroscience**: Emily Falk's lab at University of Pennsylvania found that people are more willing to share information that "engages neural activity in regions related to self-presentation"—stories about themselves and others activate the medial prefrontal cortex.

**Hormonal response**: Paul Zak showed that narratives with a "dramatic arc" increase oxytocin (the "love hormone," facilitating relationships) and cortisol (the "stress hormone," aiding memory formation and reducing inflammation).

## Fear and the Brain

Shiller connects financial behavior to primitive neurological patterns:

**Bankers' risk-taking in 2017**: Ten years after the 2007-9 financial crisis, banks were taking excessive risks by investing in longer-term securities despite low interest rates. Their decisions weren't based on proven forecasting—no one can reliably predict interest rates years ahead—but on fading memories of narratives about past periods when rates rose dramatically.

**Pavlov's dogs**: Dogs conditioned to associate a metronome with acid on their tongue eventually reacted to the metronome alone. When the acid stopped, the fear response gradually extinguished—but not completely.

**Amygdala and fear extinction**: In rats, neurons in the lateral amygdala fire during fear acquisition and reduce firing during extinction—but some neurons retain residual fear. The same neural circuitry (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus) exists in humans. The thickness of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlates with success in fear extinction.

**PTSD and collective fear**: Czeslaw Milosz described how fear under Stalinism created a "collective aura" over entire populations. This same brain circuitry, evolved over millions of years, influences financial decisions when logical answers are unavailable.

## Historical Recognition of Narrative Contagion

**David Hume (1742)** recognized that although some individuals escape "the contagion," the "multitude will certainly be seized by the common affection."

**Alexander Windmill's 1765 letter** described an epidemic of the sentence "THERE IS NO MONEY" during an economic depression in the American colonies. He calculated (with exaggeration) that it was being repeated 50 million times daily—people repeating the same complaint every two hours as if hearing it for the first time.

**Charles Mackay (1841)** documented "extraordinary popular delusions." **Gustave Le Bon (1895)** wrote that "ideas, sentiments, emotions, and beliefs possess in crowds a contagious power as intense as that of microbes." Later thinkers coined terms like **collective consciousness** (Durkheim), **collective memory** (Halbwachs), and **memes** (Dawkins).

## Engineered Contagion

**Book jackets**: Modern dust jackets—with endorsements, eye-catching fonts, author photos—were invented in the 1920s. Initially, readers protested, declaring they threw them away immediately. Yet the jackets flourished because they increased contagion: people saw them in shop windows, left them on coffee tables, and spread the narrative to visitors. This is what Shiller and George Akerlof call a **"phishing equilibrium"** —in a competitive market, no company can refuse such manipulations and survive.

**News as engineered product**: The news media choose stories based on viral potential. The 2017 solar eclipse received relentless coverage as a "once in a lifetime" event—even though another total eclipse would occur in the US just seven years later.

**Company logos**: The word "logo" dates only to the 1930s. Lacoste's crocodile logo originally benefited from tennis star René Lacoste's fame. Today, the man is forgotten but the logo persists. People reach for logo products because they're familiar and because so many others wear them—not because of conscious designer preference.

## Beauty Contests and Sexual Selection

**Theory of mind**: Humans uniquely develop models of what others are thinking. We observe facial expressions, vocal intonation, and actions to infer beliefs and intentions.

**Keynes's beauty contest metaphor** (1936): In a newspaper contest where readers must pick the six prettiest faces from a hundred photos, the optimal strategy isn't picking your own favorites—it's picking what you think *others* will find prettiest. And beyond that, what you think others think others will find prettiest. This describes speculative markets: investors try to guess what other investors are thinking about what other investors are thinking.

**Sexual selection**: Ornithologist Richard Prum argues that sexual selection creates fluctuations resembling speculative bubbles. The peacock's heavy, useless tail feathers are favored by females—a "Fisherian runaway" where ornaments become popular simply because they randomly began to be popular. Similarly, economic narratives can go viral for no reason other than that they randomly started to catch on.

## Psychological Insights

**Jerome Bruner**: "I do not believe that facts ever quite stare anybody in the face. Our factual worlds are more like cabinetry carefully carpentered than like a virgin forest inadvertently stumbled upon."

**Dysnarrativia**: Brain injury can produce narrative disorders—arrested narration, undernarration, denarration, confabulation—revealing how fundamental storytelling is to normal cognition.

**Framing and heuristics**: How a story is framed influences decisions. The **representativeness heuristic** (Kahneman and Tversky) means people judge probabilities by similarity to remembered stories rather than by logic. The **affect heuristic** means strong emotions (fear, excitement) extend to unrelated events.

**Seemingly irrelevant triggers**: Shiller's research with William Goetzmann and Dasol Kim found that:
- Local earthquakes increased respondents' estimated probability of a stock market crash
- World Cup outcomes affect economic confidence
- Shark attacks at local beaches affect votes for local incumbents
- Background music in advertisements affects consumer choices

**Internet trolls**: Trolling behavior is contagious—people primed with nasty examples become more likely to post similar comments.

## Key Insight

The diverse evidence from neuroscience, history, marketing, psychology, and biology converges on a single conclusion: **narrative contagion is a fundamental human phenomenon with deep biological roots**. Understanding how narratives go viral requires drawing on insights from across the sciences and humanities—a truly consilient approach that sets the stage for the foundational principles to come in Part II.
