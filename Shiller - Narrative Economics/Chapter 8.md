# Summary of Chapter 8: Seven Propositions of Narrative Economics

In this chapter, Shiller distills the insights from previous chapters into **seven foundational propositions** that provide a framework for understanding how economic narratives spread and influence behavior.

## Proposition 1: Epidemics Can Be Fast or Slow, Big or Small

Economic narrative epidemics vary tremendously in their timing and magnitude. There is no standard course.

**Fast epidemics**: The October 19, 1987 stock market crash—the biggest one-day drop in US history—spread with astonishing speed. Shiller's survey found that **97% of respondents heard about it on the day of the drop**, with the average person learning at 1:56 PM Eastern Time. They heard by direct word-of-mouth as the event was happening, not through newspapers or evening news.

**Slow epidemics**: Patriotic stories illustrating national greatness may spread slowly over decades through classrooms, civic organizations, and family traditions—but can become huge epidemics if the forgetting rate is low enough.

**Best seller lists mislead**: The *New York Times* best seller list reflects weekly sales, so the Bible and Koran never appear. Most past best sellers are forgotten today—they were "flash-in-the-pan" short-term epidemics.

## Proposition 2: Important Economic Narratives May Comprise a Very Small Percentage of Popular Talk

The most economically significant narratives may generate surprisingly little conversation.

**Arthur Krock's 1932 investigation**: The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist traveled 10,000 miles, visited 20 US cities, and recorded casual conversations during the depths of the Great Depression. He found almost all talk was banal—"Little did I hear of books or plays. Not one new joke... Not a word of personal enthusiasm for any candidate."

Yet a **Cleveland taxi driver** told him: "If you want to know how things are here, watch the garbage cans behind the all-night restaurants about 3 o'clock mornings. See the guys who are getting their meals that way. They aren't all bums by a long shot."

This single vivid image—respectable men reduced to eating garbage—conveys more about Depression-era economic behavior than hours of abstract discussion. The driver's urgent question—"When do you suppose it will come back?"—reveals how narratives shape spending decisions.

**Rarely discussed decisions**: People almost never talk about how much to save for retirement—yet they must decide. These decisions may be influenced by narratives like those Depression men eating from garbage cans.

## Proposition 3: Narrative Constellations Have More Impact Than Any One Narrative

Individual narratives reinforce each other within constellations. The pronoun **"they"** ("They say that...") signals that the teller is drawing on a constellation of authoritative-sounding stories.

**Cryptocurrency constellation**: By 2018, nearly two thousand cryptocurrencies competed with Bitcoin. Each is a story of entrepreneurship. But the largest constellation focuses on Bitcoin-related stories—like singer Lily Allen turning down payment in Bitcoin in 2009, only to realize she would have been a billionaire by 2017. Such stories invoke regret and sustain interest.

**Difficulty of measurement**: Most narratives are never written down and are lost forever. They sit in the background, rarely expressed when decisions are made. Discussing whether to buy a new car, spouses don't usually recount the specific stories making them feel secure or insecure.

## Proposition 4: The Economic Impact of Narratives May Change Through Time

The same narrative can have different effects in different contexts.

**World War I vs. World War II**: At the start of WWI (July 1914), stock prices fell precipitously, and the NYSE closed until December. At the start of WWII (September 1939), the S&P Composite Index gained 9.6% in one day. Why? A narrative had developed that WWI investors who held on ultimately profited from selling armaments to Europe. The human stories were similar, but the narrative about successful investors was completely different.

**Portfolio insurance in 1987**: The crash narrative that year was tied to computerized trading programs. Other crashes had entirely different associated narratives.

**Names matter**: Seemingly minor changes in a narrative's name can matter enormously, especially if the new name attaches to a different constellation. In neurolinguistics, synonyms have different neural connections.

## Proposition 5: Truth Is Not Enough to Stop False Narratives

False narratives can be remarkably persistent.

**The "Cult of the Offensive"** (pre-WWI): This false narrative held that the country that attacks first has the advantage. It led to instability—everyone wanted to attack first. Germany thought it had a "window of opportunity" for "preventive war" against Russia. The narrative was wrong, but Norman Angell's corrective book *The Great Illusion* (1911) didn't go viral fast enough to prevent the war. The illusion won even after being disproven.

**Medical adherence**: The World Health Organization found only about 50% of patients in developed countries consistently follow doctors' orders for chronic illnesses. Truth alone doesn't ensure compliance.

**Twitter study** (Vosoughi et al., 2018): False stories had **six times the retweeting rate** as true stories. People are "more likely to share novel information"—the urge to titillate and surprise others drives contagion, not accuracy.

## Proposition 6: Contagion of Economic Narratives Builds on Opportunities for Repetition

Frequent opportunities to slip a narrative into conversation increase contagion.

**Stock price indexes**: Contagion rates for stock market narratives probably increased in the 1920s-30s when the public began paying attention to indexes. The same happened with home price indexes after the 1970s.

**"Happy Birthday to You"**: This song may be the most contagious narrative in history—spread around the world in countless translations. It's not particularly beautiful; it spreads because birthdays constantly recur. The song mutated from "Good Morning to All" (1893) by changing just a few words:

> Good morning to you → Happy birthday to you
> Good morning dear children → Happy birthday dear [name]

The slight change made it part of the growing birthday ritual, personalized by inserting the celebrant's name. The original authors couldn't have predicted this—there are roughly **10 quadrillion possible variants** of the song. The successful mutation was a random event that happened to catch on.

## Proposition 7: Narratives Thrive on Human Interest, Identity, and Patriotism

**George Washington and the cherry tree**: This story—"I can't tell a lie, Pa; you know I can't tell a lie. I did cut it with my hatchet"—is remembered 200 years later primarily because it's about the first US president. About almost anyone else, it would be forgotten. The story reinforces narratives about American honesty, which may have boosted the US economy by creating trust in business dealings.

**Quote attribution**: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" was emphasized by socialist Louis Blanc in 1851, when Marx was virtually unknown. A variation appears in the Bible. Yet today it's attributed to Marx. Unknown persons started a mutated epidemic by attaching a new celebrity.

**Patriotism**: CBS News' "Your World in 90 Seconds" covers almost exclusively US news (plus British royalty and Putin). The title is accurate for many Americans who think the US *is* the world, despite having only 5% of the population. This preference for domestic narratives helps explain why international idea contagion often goes unrecognized.

## Key Insight

These seven propositions form a toolkit for understanding economic narratives. They emphasize that narratives are not simply true or false, fast or slow—they have complex dynamics involving constellations, changing meanings, human interest, and opportunities for repetition. Recognizing these patterns helps economists move beyond simple quantitative models toward a deeper understanding of how stories shape economic behavior.
