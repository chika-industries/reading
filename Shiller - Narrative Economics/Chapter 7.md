# Summary of Chapter 7: Causality and Constellations

In this chapter, Shiller tackles one of the most challenging questions in narrative economics: **How do we know whether narratives cause economic events, or merely reflect them?**

## The Direction of Causality

The fundamental problem: Do stories of successful speculators cause stock prices to rise, or do rising prices cause the stories? Does Bitcoin enthusiasm drive its price, or does the price increase create the enthusiasm?

Economists cannot run controlled experiments on entire economies. Unlike medical researchers who can give test drugs to experimental groups and placebos to controls, economists must infer causality from natural experiments—random shocks that occur through history.

**Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz** (1963) used "quasi-controlled experiments" to establish monetary policy's causal impact:
- Gold discoveries of 1897-1914 (expanded money supply)
- World War I and II periods

These events were likely exogenous—caused by factors outside the economy (gold rush stories, foreign conspiracy narratives).

## Cultural Entrepreneurs

Historian Joel Mokyr calls narrative creators **"cultural entrepreneurs"** —individuals whose ideas can spark major change. Philosopher David Hume (1742) anticipated this:

> "What depends on a few persons is, in great measure, to be ascribed to chance... what arises from a great number may often be accounted for by determinate and known causes."

The "few persons" who create contagious narratives are usually not famous. We often never know their names. Later, celebrities may become attached to their stories, but the original authors remain obscure.

## Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

Sociologist Robert Merton coined this phrase in 1948, intending it to apply to economic fluctuations. The classic example is **sunspots**—astronomer William Stanley Jevons (1878) proposed that solar cycles caused economic fluctuations. While this theory failed, economists now use "sunspots" to mean any extraneous noise that affects the economy because people believe it will.

**Roger Farmer** has led research on macroeconomic self-fulfilling prophecies. Shiller adds that these prophecies don't come from nowhere—they emerge from millions of narrative mutations, of which a few become contagious epidemics.

## Random Events and Exogenous Shocks

**Celebrities' offhand phrases** can have massive effects:

- **Irving Fisher's "permanently high plateau"** (October 15, 1929)—two weeks before the crash. This spectacularly ill-timed phrase became an epidemic, probably affecting the market debacle's duration, and is still remembered today alongside "irrational exuberance" and "Laffer curve."

**Anniversaries** resurrect old narratives. The 1987 crash narrative resurfaces on major anniversaries—until a bigger one-day crash occurs.

**Mutations keep narratives alive**: By 2013, Bitcoin was fading ($1000 peak to just over $200). Then **initial coin offerings (ICOs)** emerged—over 900 in 2017 alone—each tied to a particular coin and business line. This flood of new narratives revived the old sport of stock-picking.

## The Tyranny of Metrics

Historian Jerry Muller warns that quantitative indexes (GDP, wage rates, interest rates) lead people to **overestimate the importance of arbitrary quantifications**. Economists fall into this trap because abundant data exists for these metrics, while narrative data is spotty. But trying to understand religious awakenings by counting the cost of religious tracts misses the point entirely.

## Controlled Experiments from Outside Economics

While economists can't run experiments on whole economies, other fields provide evidence of narrative causality:

**Marketing**: Jennifer Edson Escalas found that **narrative self-referencing** (imagining oneself as another person using "I") is more effective than analytical self-referencing (explaining why you need the product)—especially when the analytical case is weak.

**Journalism**: Marcel Machill showed that viewers retain news better when it's presented as a story with a protagonist (a baker with health problems caused by air pollution) fighting antagonists (those benefiting from pollution).

**Education**: Scott McQuiggan found that students learning microbiology through a virtual reality game—playing the role of Alyx whose father is stricken by a mysterious disease—showed greater "self-efficacy, presence, interest, and perception of control."

**Health interventions**: Michael Slater found didactic presentations on nutrition ineffective. Narrative messages worked better when audiences identified with the persons portrayed.

**Philanthropy**: Keith Weber found narrative messages more effective than statistics in getting people to sign organ donor cards.

**Law**: Brad Bell and Elizabeth Loftus found that adding an irrelevant vivid detail ("knocked over a bowl of guacamole dip onto the white shag carpet") helped obtain convictions from experimental juries.

## The Importance of Stories

Historian William Cronon compares scholarly history to historical novels: historians don't represent aspects of the past their documents are silent about—but stream-of-consciousness and informal conversation are so fundamental to life that it's hard to say which is more distorting: a history saying nothing about them, or fiction trying to represent them responsibly.

**The "economy-as-sick-or-healthy-person" metaphor** dominates popular media. The economy is described as needing a doctor (fiscal or monetary policy) with a thermometer called "confidence."

**Psychologist Robert Sternberg** wrote that healthy loving relationships are made possible by a narrative of the relationship. Similarly, the economy's story has moral dimensions—loyalty vs. opportunism, trust vs. distrust—that simple confidence indexes miss.

## Flashbulb Memory

Certain poignant narratives produce such strong emotional reactions that people remember them years later. Psychologists Brown and Kulik (1977) coined this term for memories of events like JFK's assassination.

**Examples**:
- A first sergeant in 1861 remembered exactly what he was doing when told he must lead his men on a potentially deadly mission
- People in 1941 remembered precisely where they were when they heard about Pearl Harbor
- Americans today remember stories of what they were doing on September 11, 2001

**September 11, 2001**: The US was already in recession (since March 2001). After the attacks, many feared the recession would deepen. Instead, it ended in November 2001—one of the shortest recessions in US history. President Bush's narrative asked Americans to "get on board," "fly and enjoy America's great destination spots," "get down to Disney World." This flashbulb-quality narrative encouraged patriotic spending and courage, profoundly affecting the recovery.

## The Ubiquity of Fake News

Fake news is not new—people have always spread stories they suspect aren't true. Urban legends, fake wrestling matches (dating to ancient Rome's *prolusio*), and obvious fakery all attract audiences who enjoy pretending it's real.

**Source monitoring** is difficult for the brain. Over time, we may forget that we once deemed a story unreliable. Brain damage can cause extreme defects in source monitoring.

**Fact-checking websites** (Snopes, PolitiFact, etc.) have emerged, but most people don't read them. A 2018 *Science* study by Soroush Vosoughi found that **false stories had six times the retweeting rate on Twitter as true stories**. People are "more likely to share novel information"—the urge to titillate and surprise others drives contagion, not truth.

## Key Insight

Once we recognize that newly mutated stories within narrative constellations can **cause** current economic events, we've made substantial progress. But establishing causality is difficult—we must look beyond single narratives to constellations, beyond single events to confluences, and beyond quantitative metrics to the stories people actually tell.

The seeds of a financial panic may be planted over months or years, even if the panic itself unfolds in days. The mass of people whose decisions drive economic fluctuations are not well-informed—they don't carefully read the news. Attention-getting narratives, often with celebrity assists, drive their decisions. Understanding this is the first step toward incorporating narratives into economic theory.
