# Summary of Chapter 5: The Laffer Curve and Rubik's Cube Go Viral

In this chapter, Shiller examines two cultural phenomena from the 1970s and 1980s—one economic, one purely playful—to understand what makes narratives contagious and how they influence real-world outcomes.

## The Challenge of Predicting Virality

Shiller begins by acknowledging that predicting which narratives will go viral is extraordinarily difficult. He quotes motion picture executives:

- **Jack Valenti**: "No one, absolutely no one can tell you what a movie is going to do in the marketplace. Not until the film opens in a darkened theater and sparks fly up between the screen and the audience can you say this film is right."
- **William Goldman**: "Nobody knows anything. Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what's going to work."

The existence of "one-hit wonders" in both entertainment and economics proves that the same creators often cannot replicate their success.

## The Laffer Curve Narrative

The **Laffer curve**—a simple diagram showing the relationship between tax rates and government revenue—became one of economics' most famous viral ideas.

**The origin story**: In 1974, economist Arthur Laffer allegedly drew the curve on a napkin during a steak dinner at Washington's Two Continents restaurant with journalist Jude Wanniski and top White House officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. The napkin later became a Smithsonian artifact.

**The punch line**: If the tax rate is 0%, revenue is zero. If it's 100%, no one works, so revenue is also zero. Between these extremes lies an inverted U-shape—meaning the *same* revenue can be collected at two different tax rates. The implication: if we're on the "wrong" side of the curve, cutting taxes could *increase* revenue.

**Why it went viral**:

1. **Visual imagery**: The napkin detail made the story memorable and "iconic"—even though Laffer himself later noted the restaurant used cloth napkins, not paper
2. **Political timing**: It justified tax cuts just as Ronald Reagan (US) and Margaret Thatcher (UK) rose to power
3. **Celebrity association**: The napkin story linked Laffer to powerful Washington figures
4. **Moral simplicity**: It suggested that politicians who raised taxes were fools

**Epidemic pattern**: Figure 5.1 shows two Laffer curve epidemics—the first peaking around 1980, the second rising after 2000 in connection with "modern monetary theory" narratives.

## The Power of Visual Imagery

Shiller draws on ancient wisdom and modern psychology to explain why the napkin detail mattered:

- **Cicero**: "Those things are most strongly fixed in our minds... which are communicated to them, and imprinted upon them, by the senses"—especially sight
- **Memory research**: Unusual mental images aid recall. Memory specialist Harry Lorayne advises forming "silly or impossible" mental images (like "a gigantic key growing in a flowerpot")
- **Neuroscience**: Long-term memory formation involves visual-image processing regions of the brain

The napkin provided exactly such a striking mental image—a professor so gripped by his idea that he breaks etiquette at a fancy restaurant to make officials see its brilliance.

## Parallel Epidemics: Rubik's Cube

Around the same time, **Rubik's Cube** (invented 1974) went viral for similar reasons:

- It represented deep mathematical principles (connections to quantum mechanics and quarks)
- *Scientific American* featured it in a 1981 cover story by Douglas Hofstadter, author of the bestselling *Gödel, Escher, Bach*
- It had visual appeal and puzzle-solving satisfaction

Though just a toy, Rubik's Cube followed the same hump-shaped epidemic curve as the Laffer curve—rising dramatically, then fading.

## The Supply-Side Constellation

The Laffer curve was part of a larger **narrative constellation** called **supply-side economics**, which included:

**Swedish tax horror stories**: Reports that Sweden's tax system had created marginal rates over 100%—people who worked more ended up with less after-tax income. Children's author Astrid Lindgren wrote an adult fairy tale, "Pomperipossa in the World of Money," about this absurdity, contributing to the downfall of the Palme government in 1976.

**Highest tax bracket narratives**: In the 1950s, even though top US income tax rates reached 84-92%, ProQuest shows only 33 stories mentioning the "highest tax bracket." In the 1980s—with rates *falling* from 70% to 28%—there were 520 such stories.

**Welfare mother narratives**: The term exploded from zero in 1960 to a peak in the early 1970s, focusing attention on those supposedly benefiting from others' taxes.

**Proposition 13 and taxpayer revolt**: California's 1978 property tax limit spawned imitators across half the states, fueled by stories of homeowners forced to sell because they could no longer afford their taxes.

**Ayn Rand's novels**: *The Fountainhead* (1943) and especially *Atlas Shrugged* (1957) promoted free-market, anti-government narratives that grew slowly but steadily over decades—a slower but ultimately larger epidemic than short-lived stories like the taxpayer revolt.

## Celebrities and Memorable Phrases

Ronald Reagan amplified these narratives with memorable quips:

> "Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it."

The quip had existed since at least 1967, but Reagan's celebrity made it truly contagious. Its poetic three-part structure aided memorization and transmission.

Reagan also told jokes contrasting American entrepreneurship with Soviet inefficiency—like the Russian who orders a car, is told delivery will take ten years, and asks "Morning or afternoon?" because "the plumber's coming in the morning."

## Key Insight

The Laffer curve narrative's success wasn't primarily about economic substance—it was about **storytelling elements**: a striking visual (the napkin), powerful celebrities (Reagan, Thatcher, Cheney), moral simplicity, and connection to a larger constellation of related narratives. These elements raised its contagion rate above the forgetting rate, creating an epidemic that helped reshape tax policy for decades.

The lesson: **small narrative details—a napkin, a quip, a celebrity endorsement—can make the difference between an idea that fades and one that transforms economic policy.**
