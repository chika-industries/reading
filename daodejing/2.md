This passage from the Daodejing explains how concepts like **beauty** and **goodness** only exist in relation to their opposites, and how a wise person harmonizes with the world by practicing **wuwei**—non-action or effortless action.[1][2][3]

## Duality and Interdependence
- The text points out that when society labels something "beautiful," it simultaneously creates the concept of "ugly"; the same occurs for "good" and "bad".[4][5][1]
- These judgments show how all qualities—existence and non-existence, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, note and noise, before and after—are defined by their opposites and only have meaning in relation to each other.[2][6][5]
- This reflects the Daoist principle of **yin and yang**, which emphasizes the interdependence and mutual arising of all things.[3]

## The Sage and Wuwei
- The sage, or wise one, lives in accordance with **wuwei** ("non-action"), which is not passivity but acting in harmony with the Dao, without force or personal agenda.[7][8]
- The sage teaches through silence and example ("wordless teaching"), allowing things to arise and pass naturally, without attachment or possessiveness.[8][3]
- Achievements are not claimed; when something is accomplished, the sage lets it go, leading to lasting influence because it is not tainted by ego or ownership.[2][8]

## Labels and Their Limits
- By labeling and evaluating, the mind creates separation and suffering, since true reality (the Dao) remains beyond such divisions.[5][9]
- Daoism advises letting go of rigid judgments and distinctions, instead experiencing things directly and accepting their natural unfolding.[10][9]

### Table of Dualities

| Opposite Qualities                | How They Interact                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Beautiful/Ugly                    | Defined by comparison[1]      |
| Good/Bad                          | Created together[2]           |
| Difficult/Easy                    | Complete each other[5]        |
| Long/Short                        | Complement each other[2]      |
| High/Low                          | Rely on one another[6]        |
| Note/Noise                        | Harmonize[2]                  |
| Before/After                      | Follow one another[3]         |

## Practice of Wuwei

The sage’s **non-action** reflects alignment with nature, acting without striving or claiming, and teaching without words—living simply and letting achievements speak for themselves. The wisdom is in embracing the interdependence of opposites and refusing to cling to judgments, which brings peace and enduring influence.[3][7][8][2]
