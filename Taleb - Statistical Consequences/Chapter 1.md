## Summary of Chapter 1: Prologue

The Prologue serves as the book's introduction, establishing the core motivation and conceptual framework for understanding statistical distributions that produce extreme events.

### Main Arguments

**The Central Problem**: While many acknowledge that "fat tails" exist, there is widespread failure to grasp their profound consequences. Simply labeling a distribution as fat-tailed does not justify continuing to use standard statistical tools—it requires a fundamental overhaul of methods, metrics, and decision-making approaches.

**The Incerto Connection**: This book draws on the author's multi-volume Incerto series, which explores how to navigate a world too complex for complete understanding. The work connects five fields: mathematics, philosophy, social science, contract theory, decision theory, and practical applications. Option theory is framed as mathematical contract theory—contingent contracts designed to manage tail exposures.

**Key Insight**: While uncertainty about the world may be vast, there is often clarity about what actions to take given that uncertainty. The focus should be on survival and avoiding harm rather than perfect prediction.

### Terminology Clarification

The author distinguishes between:
- **"Thick tails"**: Higher kurtosis than Gaussian (finance practitioners' usage)
- **"Fat tails"**: Reserved for extreme thick tails or power law class membership
- Avoiding ambiguous terms like "heavy tails" or "long tails"

### Response to Criticism

The chapter concludes with an anecdote about a finance professor who complained that the author "shows what's wrong but doesn't offer substitutes." The author's counter-argument: in the real world, removing faulty metrics (via negativa) can outperform providing alternatives—much like Popperian science works by falsification. The book does offer solutions, but they require mathematical work to re-derive methods for fat-tailed conditions.
