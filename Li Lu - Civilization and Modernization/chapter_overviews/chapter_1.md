Here is a summary of the first chapter of Part One, titled **"Old Questions and New Historiography"** :

This chapter serves as an introduction to the book's central investigation into China's historical trajectory and its path to modernization. It begins by framing the core questions that have haunted Chinese intellectuals since the Opium War of 1840: Why did China fall behind the West? How can it catch up? And what will a successful, modernized China look like? The author notes that this is the flip side of a question Westerners have asked for 250 years: Why did the West come to rule the world?

Li Lu argues that traditional historical analysis, which relies primarily on written records (only about 5,500 years old in the West and 3,300 years in China), is insufficient to answer these profound questions about long-term civilizational development. Written history represents less than 1% of the human story and is inherently limited and biased.

The solution, according to the author, lies in **"New Historiography,"** a modern, interdisciplinary approach that leverages breakthroughs in various scientific fields to study history. The chapter highlights several key scientific advancements that have revolutionized our understanding of the past:

- **Radiocarbon Dating** (post-1949): Allows for accurate dating of archaeological finds, making physical artifacts as important as written texts for understanding pre-history.
- **DNA and Evolutionary Biology** (post-1950s): Provides a complete understanding of human evolution, culminating in works like E.O. Wilson's *The Social Conquest of Earth*.
- **Milankovitch Cycles** (confirmed in the 1970s): A mathematical theory explaining how Earth's orbital variations cause long-term climate cycles (ice ages), which profoundly impacted human migration and development.
- **Genetic Tracing** (1987): The discovery of "African Eve" and later "African Adam" proved that all humans share a common ancestor from Africa, refuting racial explanations for developmental differences.

Li Lu identifies two pioneering scholars of New Historiography who are central to his own analysis:
1.  **Jared Diamond** (*Guns, Germs, and Steel*): Demonstrated how geographical factors determined the origins of agriculture and why this led to Europe's conquest of the Americas.
2.  **Ian Morris** (*Why the West Rules—For Now* and *The Measure of Civilization*): Created a "social development index" to quantitatively measure and compare the long-term trajectories of Eastern and Western civilizations.

By applying the frameworks of Diamond and Morris, combined with his own understanding of economics, biology, and Chinese history, Li Lu aims to provide a deeper, more reliable answer to the "old questions" about China's place in the world and to offer a more robust prediction of its future. The chapter concludes by outlining the rest of Part One, which will use these tools to trace human history from its origins to the present, with a focus on the birth of modernity and China's unique path.
