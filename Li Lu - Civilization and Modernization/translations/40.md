**Q: Many smart people believe renewable energy is the next major revolution. You have done a lot of research on battery technology and BYD. Besides batteries, what are your insights into this field? How do you think the energy revolution will unfold?**

I focus on macro trends, and I only want to understand whether these major trends are tailwinds or headwinds for me. As a citizen concerned with current affairs, I care about the macroeconomy, but that doesn't mean I can predict how the future will develop and change; in fact, I don't know. However, in a free market, thousands of participants, in pursuit of their own maximum benefit, will always find their own way. Predicting the future is not easy; the good news is you don't need to do it.

If the broader environment is moving in the same direction as you, that's excellent. But if you are going against the trend, you'd better do more research. This is how I view the new energy issue. I know that at some point, humanity must find energy sources other than fossil fuels. On one hand, we don't have enough fossil fuels; on the other hand, we also need to preserve them for agricultural development and the security of the human food supply. (Because so far, no material can replace fertilizers based on petrochemical resources.) Furthermore, if the climate continues to deteriorate as it has in recent decades, we cannot bear the consequences and will pay the price sooner or later.

So, for many reasons, I believe humanity must find alternatives to fossil fuels. But based on this judgment alone, can I make a confident investment decision? Probably not necessarily. But if this is the general trend, I am willing to give it my all.

**VIII. On Investment Fund Compensation Structure**

**Q: Is your fund currently open to new investors?**

My fund is generally closed to new investors. We only open to new investors when we see more opportunities than the capital we have on hand, but such opportunities are very rare. I don't want to expand the scale. I have never had the ambition to run the largest fund, nor have I ever wanted to make the most money from a fund. I only hope that by the end of my career, the risk-adjusted performance of my fund will be among the best in the industry.

If I can achieve that, I will be very satisfied with myself. This is my goal, so my fund's compensation structure reflects this. I believe our compensation mechanism is reasonable, which is the original "Buffett Partnership Model." We do not charge any management fees; the first 6% of compounded annual returns go entirely to the investors, and we take 25% of the remaining gains. I have no investments outside my fund; I have placed all my own and my family's investment capital in my fund. Our firm only manages one fund. So it's a true partnership, with almost no conflicts of interest between the general partner and the limited partners.

This way, we are all in the same boat. I have no reason to raise funds just for the sake of raising funds because I cannot make money by increasing the fund size. Whenever new money comes in, I have to pay investors the 6% annual compound interest, so I'd better be able to find some worthwhile investment opportunities with better returns. This way, when I make money, I feel it's earned through my hard work; when my investors make money, they also feel it's deserved. This corporate structure is superior to others because everyone's success is earned. It is this spirit that made Buffett and Munger different.

They both believe in success earned through down-to-earth effort. This is also why they have achieved such enormous success, yet few people criticize them. If you create hundreds of billions, even trillions of wealth for investor shareholders, and for forty years, you only take a hundred thousand dollars in salary each year, others have little reason to criticize you.

**IX. On When to Sell**

**Q: How do you make the decision to sell a stock?**

There are three situations where you need to decide to sell. First, if you made a mistake, then sell as soon as possible, even if it was a "right mistake." So what is a "right mistake"? Investment is a game of probabilities. Suppose you are 90% confident, but there's a 10% chance of other possibilities, and that 10% actually happens. This is a "right mistake," and you should sell. Of course, it's also possible that your thinking and analysis were completely wrong; you thought you had a 90% chance of winning, but the opposite was true. Once you realize this is the case, you should also sell immediately. Hopefully, there isn't much loss yet, but even if there is a loss, it doesn't matter because you must sell.

The second situation is when the stock's valuation suddenly swings to another extreme. If the valuation suddenly reaches a crazy level, I will also consider selling. I won't sell a stock that is only slightly overvalued. If your judgment is correct, and you have held a company's stock for a considerable time, you have accumulated a large amount of unrealized gains. A significant portion of these gains is like an interest-free loan legally obtained from the government. So, if you sell in this situation, you remove the leverage (provided by the government) and withdraw part of the capital, then your return on equity will decrease slightly. (This is due to capital gains tax.)

The third situation for selling is when you find a better opportunity. Ultimately, a portfolio is about opportunity cost, as I mentioned before. As an investment manager, your job is to continuously improve your portfolio. You start with a high standard and keep raising it. The way to achieve this is by constantly discovering better investment opportunities and continuously optimizing opportunity costs. These are the three possibilities for which I would sell.

**X. On Short Selling**

**Q: Does Himalaya Foundation engage in short selling?**

I gave up this practice nine years ago (in 2003). One could say short selling was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made.

**Q: Is it because you want to bring constructive help to the companies you invest in?**

Yes. But there's another reason: in the process of short selling, even if you are 100% correct, you can still go bankrupt. This is what I dislike the most.

Three characteristics of short selling make it a miserable business: First, if you go long, your downside is 100%, but your upside is unlimited. If you short, your upside is only 100%, but your downside is unlimited. I really don't like this arithmetic. Second, the best short opportunities often involve elements of fraud, and fraud can persist for a long time. Because shorting necessarily involves borrowing (shares), this alone is enough to wear you down. That's why I say you can go bankrupt even if you are 100% correct. And often, you go bankrupt before you can even confirm you are correct! Finally, it messes with your thinking. The idea of shorting firmly occupies your mind, distracting you from the focus you should have on your long investments. So, for these three reasons, I stopped shorting altogether.

Short selling was a mistake I made. I had two years of experience with it. I don't despise people who are good at shorting; it's just that I'm not one of them. If I were to add another reason, it's that over the last 200 to 300 years, since the dawn of the modern technological era, the human economy has overall been growing continuously in a compound manner. Therefore, the economic development trend naturally favors going long rather than shorting.

Of course, it's impossible not to make mistakes in one's lifetime; I just want to learn something from the mistakes I've made.

**XI. On Financial Crises**

**Q: During the 16 years of managing the Himalaya Fund, you experienced three major financial crises: the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble Burst, and the 2008 Financial Crisis. How did you steer the fund through these crises? What did you learn from these experiences?**

Every financial crisis is described as a "once-in-a-century" event, although in my career, it seems I encounter one every five years. The interesting thing about these crises is that they test your degree of intellectual honesty.

In our industry, the most important thing is intellectual honesty. So-called intellectual honesty encompasses four aspects: knowing what you know, knowing what you don't know, knowing what you don't need to know, and realizing that there are always things you don't know you don't know. These four points are different. When an economic crisis comes, investors are tested on all four aspects.

For example, when the Asian Financial Crisis occurred, overnight everyone was asking, "How much debt do these companies actually have? Oh my God, they have so much debt! The whole country is going to collapse!" Everyone was stuck in crisis mode. Things you usually didn't pay much attention to or didn't care about suddenly all surfaced. Under normal circumstances, you might think, "These issues have nothing to do with the companies I invested in." In the midst of a crisis, you suddenly say, "Oh my God, this is closely related to the companies I invested in!" Of course, you might be right or wrong; the crisis will test it.

This is why people become disoriented in a crisis—because they weren't intellectually honest enough beforehand. They didn't carefully distinguish between different problems and place them into the appropriate categories. For instance, if you want to make an overall judgment about the direction of the US economy, you should know that worse situations have happened historically, and these situations can happen again. The probability might be small, but once it happens, it's unstoppable. The real question then becomes: "Is this situation an unknown unknown?" Or "Do you know that you don't need to know this?" You will inevitably face these questions.

Yes, when a crisis hits, the entire financial system can be in trouble. Yes, companies need financing, but what I can be sure of is that as long as life goes on, my business will still be there; the crisis will always end. The question to ask then is: "Do I need to figure out how the financial system will solve its own problems before I can predict the fate of my business?"

That is the real question, one you need to answer before the financial crisis affects you.

If you can answer this question honestly and correctly, you will be able to accomplish more when the crisis arrives. Christopher Davis's grandfather once said, "The most money is made during the panic of a bear market, you just don't realize it at the time." This is always true. Those investors who are not smart enough will be eliminated. The smart investors are those who have always maintained an honest attitude towards knowledge. They clearly recognize what they know, what they don't know, what they don't need to know, and that there are always unknown unknowns. As long as you can always correctly categorize problems into these four types, you will pass the test. Otherwise, you will get into trouble.

The market is a mechanism that exposes human weaknesses, especially when a financial crisis arrives. Only by being completely intellectually honest can one survive, develop, and grow in the market.

**XII. On China**

**Q: At the 2010 Columbia Business School Forum, you mentioned that Asia would play an increasingly important role in the global financial system. Could you elaborate on this view?**

Asia will become an important economic force, not just in finance. The financial aspect is just a derivative of Asia's overall economic strength. Asia, especially China, due to its scale and current development path, is becoming a significant force in the global market.

China is on the historical path of developing a modern economy. The road ahead is still long, but it has already come a very long way from the starting point. Given China's massive scale, it will inevitably have a huge impact on Asia and the world. China and the United States will form a Pacific Rim economic center, just like the Transatlantic economic center that once connected the Americas and Europe. There are many business opportunities here, but it won't be a one-way street, nor will it be smooth sailing. All sorts of situations can happen, and you are not 100% guaranteed to make money. But for those who can grasp this development, many opportunities await them. China's importance cannot be ignored.

**Q: Are you worried about China's real estate bubble? We saw a "60 Minutes" video about China's "ghost cities," which was quite shocking.**

China is so vast that extreme phenomena of all kinds exist. Yes, China has some "ghost cities," and some people worry about a real estate bubble. But China also has cities that are overcrowded—I mean the kind of crowding where every space is occupied. There are also cities that were once unknown but now are full of skyscrapers, with more and more people moving in. I remember 20 years ago, Shanghai's Pudong was half a ghost town, but today you can't help but marvel at its prosperous economy.

We live in Manhattan now; Manhattan is probably the place with the highest density of skyscrapers in the world besides Shanghai. But think about it, Shanghai has ten thousand buildings over 30 stories high, several times the number of skyscrapers in Manhattan. Even more astonishing is that China is still developing. So I say China is a paradox, always has been, and always will be. Whatever theory you want to prove, you can find evidence in China.

But overall, the Chinese economy still has a long way to go. China knows that it is still its time, but this doesn't mean it doesn't have any problems; it has many problems. The United States also has a bunch of problems; for 200 years, the US has always been like this, with many issues. If you understand the history of the American Civil War, you know the US lost 2% of its population in that war. But the US was rebuilt at an astonishing speed. After that, the US experienced two world wars. Similarly, if you thought Japan and Germany would decline after WWII, you were completely wrong.
