Here is a summary of **Section 1, "Bourgeois and Proletarians,"** from *The Communist Manifesto*.

This foundational chapter outlines Marx and Engels's theory of history as a sequence of class struggles. It focuses on the rise of the modern bourgeoisie, its revolutionary role, and how it inevitably creates the conditions for its own downfall at the hands of the proletariat.

- **Class Struggle as the Engine of History:** The chapter opens with the famous line, "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." Throughout history—between freeman and slave, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman—society has been defined by the oppression of one class by another. Modern bourgeois society has simplified these antagonisms, splitting society into two great, directly opposing classes: the **bourgeoisie** (owners of the means of production) and the **proletariat** (wage-laborers who must sell their labor to live).

- **The Rise and Revolutionary Role of the Bourgeoisie:** The bourgeoisie is a product of long economic and social developments, from the medieval towns to the age of exploration and the establishment of global markets. It has played a "most revolutionary part." It has:
    - Destroyed feudal, patriarchal relations, leaving no bond between people except "naked self-interest" and "callous 'cash payment.'"
    - Revolutionized the instruments of production constantly, leading to endless upheaval of all social conditions.
    - Created a world market, giving a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption and making nations interdependent.
    - Concentrated population, centralized means of production, and created massive, more colossal productive forces than all previous generations combined.

- **The Bourgeoisie Creates Its Own Gravediggers:** Just as the bourgeoisie rose by bursting the feudal fetters on production, modern society now faces a similar crisis. The productive forces have become too powerful for the property relations of bourgeois society, leading to periodic "commercial crises" of overproduction. In these crises, the bourgeoisie appears unable to control the powers it has summoned.

- **The Development and Victory of the Proletariat:** In creating modern industry, the bourgeoisie also created the modern working class—the proletariat.
    - The proletariat is a commodity, subject to market fluctuations. As machinery and division of labor advance, work becomes monotonous and wages are driven down.
    - Workers are organized like an army, enslaved by the machine and the individual bourgeois.
    - The proletariat develops through stages, from individual fights against the bourgeoisie to forming combinations (unions) and eventually organizing into a class and a political party.
    - As class struggle nears its decisive hour, a portion of the ruling class (bourgeois ideologists) defects to the proletariat.

- **Why the Proletariat is the Only Revolutionary Class:** Unlike other classes (the lower middle class, the peasantry) which are conservative and fight to maintain their existence, the proletariat has no property to protect. Its conditions strip it of national character and expose law, morality, and religion as mere bourgeois prejudices. The proletariat cannot gain control of productive forces without abolishing its own mode of appropriation and, therefore, all previous modes. Its movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the **immense majority**.

- **The Inevitable Conclusion:** The essential condition for the bourgeoisie's existence is capital, which relies on wage labor and competition between workers. However, the advance of industry replaces the isolation of laborers with their "revolutionary combination" through association. Therefore, the bourgeoisie produces its own "gravediggers." "Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
