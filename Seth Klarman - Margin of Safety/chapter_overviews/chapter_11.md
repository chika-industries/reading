Here is a summary of **Chapter 11: "Investing in Thrift Conversions"** .

In this chapter, Seth Klarman explores a specialized and highly lucrative niche that emerged in the 1980s: the conversion of mutual thrift institutions (savings banks and savings and loan associations) to stock ownership. He explains the unique arithmetic of these transactions and why they consistently presented attractive opportunities for value investors.

### 1. The Background: Why Thrifts Converted
Historically, most thrifts were "mutual" organizations, meaning they were owned by their depositors, not by outside shareholders. This changed in the 1980s due to financial deregulation.
- Deregulation allowed thrifts to pay market rates on deposits, but their assets were mostly fixed-rate mortgages. This created an "interest rate spread" crisis, and many thrifts lost money.
- The Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982 allowed thrifts to engage in riskier activities, leading to massive losses and insolvencies across the industry.
- Profitable and adequately capitalized thrifts saw conversion to stock ownership as a way to raise new capital to survive and grow. However, the entire thrift industry fell into disfavor, tainting even the healthy institutions.

### 2. The Unique Arithmetic of a Thrift Conversion
Thrift conversions are fundamentally different from a typical initial public offering (IPO), and this difference creates the opportunity.

- **In a typical IPO:** Existing insiders sell their cheap, pre-offering shares to the public at a much higher price. The public's investment is immediately diluted to benefit the insiders.
- **In a thrift conversion:** There are **no prior shareholders**. The thrift's existing net worth (built up over decades) is simply added to the new money raised from the public.
    - For example, a thrift with $10 million of net worth issues 1 million shares at $10 each, raising $10 million.
    - Pro forma, the company has $20 million of net worth and 1 million shares outstanding.
    - The new shareholders own a company with a book value of **$20 per share**, even though they only paid $10. The pre-existing capital is handed to them "for free."
- Furthermore, insiders (management) buy shares at the **same price** as the public, aligning their interests with outside investors. This transparency is unique to thrift conversions.

### 3. Why Thrift Stocks Were Depressed
Despite this compelling arithmetic, thrift conversion stocks were frequently issued at bargain prices and often remained undervalued after trading began.
- **Wall Street Neglect:** Few analysts followed the thrift industry. The sell-side focused on the ten largest thrifts; the buy-side made little effort to understand the hundreds of converting institutions.
- **Industry Stigma:** The entire thrift industry was tainted by the S&L crisis. Investors painted all thrifts with the same brush, regardless of their individual health. A well-capitalized, conservatively run thrift traded at the same depressed multiples as a reckless, insolvent one.

### 4. Analyzing a Thrift Investment
Klarman stresses that thrift conversions are not automatic buys. Investors must apply fundamental analysis with extreme conservatism, given the high financial leverage of banks.
- **Avoid the Unanalyzable:** If a thrift is investing in junk bonds, complex mortgages, or exotic loans, Klarman says to "shun" it. His simple rule: "If you don't quickly comprehend what a company is doing, then management probably doesn't either."
- **Adjust Book Value:** Investors must look beyond stated book value. Adjust *upward* for understated assets (appreciated securities, below-market leases, the value of a low-cost deposit base). Adjust *downward* for bad loans, intangibles, and investments worth less than cost.
- **Focus on Quality of Earnings:** Recurring income from the spread between loan yields and deposit costs is far more valuable than nonrecurring gains from securities sales or loan origination fees.

### 5. Jamaica Savings Bank: A Case Study
Klarman presents the June 1990 conversion of Jamaica Savings Bank (JSB Financial) as an ideal example.
- **The Context:** This was the height of the S&L crisis. Real estate was collapsing, and thrift stocks were hated.
- **The Institution:** JSB was the opposite of a troubled thrift. It had a 13.5% capital ratio (one of the highest in the country). Two-thirds of its assets were in U.S. Treasury securities, not risky loans.
- **The Arithmetic:** The shares were offered at $10, which was only **47% of pro forma book value** ($21.12 per share). Investors were buying dollars for less than fifty cents.
- **The Opportunity:** Half the proceeds from the offering ($80 million) were held as excess cash at the holding company. Klarman illustrates that if JSB used that cash to repurchase shares at a 40% premium to the IPO price (still a discount to book), the remaining shares' book value would jump to $25. This demonstrated the built-in margin of safety. Management, who bought shares in the offering, was committed to such value-enhancing buybacks.

**Conclusion:** Thrift conversions illustrate how the "herd mentality" can cause all companies in an out-of-favor industry to be undervalued, regardless of their individual merits. The unique arithmetic of these transactions—buying into a company where pre-existing capital is added to your own investment—created a persistent and lucrative niche for value investors willing to look past the stigma and do the analytical work.
