Here is a summary of the remaining chapters of the guide: **Chapter 3 (Information good to know)** and **Chapter 4 (Documents to be attached)** .

### Chapter 3 Summary: Good-to-Know Information

This chapter covers special situations, corrections, and additional obligations that may apply to taxpayers.

**3-1. Taxation of Interest & Dividends**
- Taxpayers can often choose how dividend income from listed stocks is taxed (aggregate taxation or separate self-assessment taxation).
- There is a **"System that Eliminates the Need to Declare"** for small-lot dividends and interest, where withholding at the source completes the tax payment.
- Dividends from foreign corporations or certain investment trusts are not eligible for the dividend credit.

**3-2. Reporting Retirement Income**
- If you need to file a return for retirement income (e.g., from a foreign company), you must use a separate section on Page 3 of the return.
- The calculation method depends on the type of retirement allowance (General, Short-term, or Specified Officer).

**3-3 & 3-4. Disasters & Late Payments**
- **Disasters:** If you suffer from a disaster, you may be eligible for filing extensions, the casualty loss deduction, or special tax reductions.
- **Late Payments:** If you pay late, a delinquent tax (penalty interest) will be charged at rates ranging from 7.3% to 14.6% per annum, depending on how late the payment is.

**3-5. Correcting Mistakes (Amended Returns)**
- If you discover a mistake after the filing deadline:
    - **Underpaid:** File an "Amended Return" to pay the additional tax.
    - **Overpaid:** File a "Request for Correction" to get a refund. (Requests are generally allowed within 5 years).

**3-6. Estimated Tax Prepayments**
- If your tax from the previous year was high (150,000 yen+), the tax office may require you to prepay estimated taxes for the current year in two installments (July and November).
- You can apply for a reduction of this prepayment if your income drops significantly.

**3-7. Consumption Tax Obligations**
- **For Business Owners:** If your taxable sales exceed 10 million yen in a base period, you become liable for consumption tax (similar to VAT/GST).
- **Invoice System (Qualified Invoice System):** Information on the new "invoice system" for consumption tax deductions is mentioned. Businesses wishing to issue invoices must register.

**3-8. Reporting Assets**
- **Report of Assets and Liabilities:** Required for those with high income (over 20 million yen) and significant assets (over 300 million yen or 100 million yen in specific exit-tax assets).
- **Report of Foreign Assets:** Required for residents (excluding non-permanent residents) with foreign assets exceeding 50 million yen. The deadline for these reports is **June 30, 2025**.

**3-9 to 3-11. International & Departure Rules**
- **Tax Treaties:** Non-residents may be eligible for reduced tax rates under tax treaties between Japan and their home country.
- **Leaving Japan:** If you leave Japan in 2025 and do not appoint a tax agent, you generally must file a "quasi-final return" before your departure.
- **Tax Agent:** If you leave Japan but still have tax obligations, you must appoint a tax agent residing in Japan and file a notification with the tax office.

**3-12 & 3-13. Notifications**
- **Hometown Tax (Furusato Nozei):** Even if you used the "One-Stop Special System," you must report all donations in your final return if you are filing one for any other reason (e.g., medical deductions).
- **Local Government Notes:** Information on how adjustments from the income tax return (like the flat amount cut and housing loan credits) affect your local inhabitant tax for the following fiscal year.

### Chapter 4 Summary: Documents to be Attached or Presented

This chapter lists the specific documents required to support claims made on the tax return.

- **Identification (My Number):** You must prove your identity by presenting or attaching copies of documents like the **My Number Card** (front and back) OR a combination of a **Notification Card** and a **Driver's License/Passport**.
- **Income Documents (for Business Owners):** You must attach financial statements:
    - **Blue Return Filers:** "Financial statement for blue return."
    - **White Return Filers:** "Statement of earnings and expenses."
- **Supporting Documents for Deductions:** For almost every deduction claimed, you need a supporting document (certificate or receipt):
    - **Insurance Premiums:** Certificates of payments for life, earthquake, and social insurance.
    - **Medical Expenses:** "Detailed statement of deduction for medical expenses."
    - **Donations:** Receipts from the donee organization (e.g., for Furusato Nozei).
