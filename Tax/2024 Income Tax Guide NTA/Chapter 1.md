### Chapter 1 Summary: Introduction

This chapter provides an introduction to Japan's final tax return process for the 2024 tax year, outlining key dates, taxpayer classifications, and filing requirements.

**1. Key Deadlines & Procedures**
- **Filing Period:** The tax return for income earned in the 2024 calendar year (Jan 1 – Dec 31) must be filed from **February 17 (Monday) to March 17 (Monday), 2025**.
- **Refund Deadline:** If you are expecting a tax refund, the Tax Office will accept your return earlier, from **February 14 (Friday), 2025**.
- **Filing Methods:** Returns can be filed by mail, in person at the tax office, or online via e-Tax.
- **Payment Methods:** Taxes can be paid via account transfer, credit card, smartphone apps, internet banking, at convenience stores (using a QR code), or in cash at financial institutions.

**2. What is a Final Return?**
- Japan uses a **self-assessment system** where taxpayers calculate their own income and tax. The final return is the procedure to settle any differences between the tax you owe and the tax already withheld from your income (like from salaries) or paid through estimated tax prepayments.
- A **"Special Income Tax for Reconstruction"** (2.1% of your income tax) is added to the income tax for the years 2013 through 2037 to fund recovery from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. The guide refers to the combined total as "income tax etc."

**3. Taxpayers & Taxable Income (Residential Status)**
Your tax liability depends on your residential status:
- **Residents:** Those with a domicile or residence in Japan for one year or more.
    - **Non-Permanent Residents:** Non-Japanese nationals with a residence in Japan for 5 years or less within the last 10 years. They are taxed on all income except foreign-source income that is not paid in or remitted to Japan.
    - **Other Residents:** Taxed on their **entire income**, regardless of where it is earned.
- **Non-Residents:** Individuals who are not residents. They are only taxed on their **domestic-source income** (income originating in Japan).

**4. Income Types & Taxation Methods**
Income is categorized (e.g., business, employment, dividend, capital gains). There are three main ways it is taxed:
- **Aggregate Taxation:** Income is combined with other types of income on the final return to calculate the total tax.
- **Separate Self-assessment Taxation:** Income is calculated separately from other income on the final return.
- **Sep. Taxation at Source:** Tax is withheld when the income is received, and this completes the tax payment (no final return needed for that income).

**5. Who Needs to File?**
A final return is generally required if your tax was not fully settled through withholding or year-end adjustments. Examples include:
- Self-employed individuals.
- Salary earners with an annual salary exceeding 20 million yen.
- Salary earners with other income (e.g., side income) exceeding 200,000 yen.
- Individuals with public pension income who still owe tax after deductions.

**6. Who is Eligible for a Refund?**
You can file a return to claim a refund if too much tax was withheld from your income. This applies to people who can claim deductions (e.g., for medical expenses, dependents) that were not accounted for during the year, or those who stopped working mid-year without having their year-end adjustment done.

**7. Place for Tax Payment**
Returns must be filed with the Tax Office (or its Submission Processing Center) that has jurisdiction over your address (domicile) as of the filing date.
