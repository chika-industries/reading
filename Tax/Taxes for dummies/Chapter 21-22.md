### Chapter 21: Tax-Wise Personal Finance Decisions
This chapter shifts focus from tax preparation to year-round tax planning, emphasizing that taxes should be a key consideration in all major financial decisions.

- **Including Taxes in Financial Planning:** Taxes impact nearly every aspect of your financial life, including spending, saving for retirement, investing, and protecting your assets. Making tax-wise decisions can significantly improve your long-term financial health.
- **Common Tax Mistakes:** The chapter identifies frequent errors people make, such as:
    - Seeking advice **after** making a major financial decision instead of before.
    - **Failing to withhold enough taxes** (or over-withholding and giving the government an interest-free loan).
    - **Overlooking legitimate deductions** out of fear of an audit.
    - **Passing up retirement accounts** and missing out on tax-deferred growth and potential employer matches.
    - **Ignoring tax considerations when investing** (e.g., not considering the tax impact of frequent trading).
    - **Not buying a home** and missing out on mortgage interest and property tax deductions.
    - **Letting political views distort investment decisions** (e.g., selling stocks based on election outcomes).
    - **Ignoring the financial aid "tax" system** when saving for college (money in the child's name is assessed more heavily).
    - **Neglecting the timing of income and deductions** to shift them into lower-tax years.
    - **Not using tax advisors effectively** or hiring the wrong type of advisor.
- **Causes of Bad Tax Decisions:** The chapter explores the root causes of poor tax planning, including:
    - **Bad advice from commissioned salespeople** ("financial planners" who are actually brokers).
    - **Misleading advertising** that pushes products based on supposed tax savings.
    - **Overspending**, which leaves no money to invest in tax-advantaged accounts.
    - **Financial illiteracy** and a lack of basic personal finance education.

### Chapter 22: Trimming Taxes with Retirement Accounts
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of how retirement accounts can be used to significantly reduce your current and future tax burden.

- **Benefits of Retirement Accounts:**
    - **Tax-Deductible Contributions:** Contributions to traditional 401(k)s, IRAs, and SEP-IRAs reduce your current taxable income, saving you money on taxes today.
    - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Earnings on investments inside the account grow tax-free until you withdraw them in retirement, allowing your money to compound faster.
    - **Potential Employer Match:** Many employers match a portion of your contributions, which is essentially free money.
    - **Saver's Credit:** Lower-income earners may also qualify for a tax credit (up to 50% of contributions) for saving in a retirement account.
- **Types of Retirement Accounts:**
    - **Employer-Sponsored Plans:** Includes **401(k)** (for-profit companies) and **403(b)** (non-profits). Employees can contribute pre-tax dollars, up to $19,500 in 2021 (plus a $6,500 catch-up for those 50+). Some plans also offer a Roth option.
    - **SIMPLE Plans:** For small businesses with fewer than 100 employees, allowing employee contributions and required employer matching.
    - **SEP-IRAs:** For self-employed individuals and small business owners, allowing contributions of up to 25% of net earnings (up to $58,000 in 2021).
    - **Solo 401(k)s:** For self-employed individuals with no employees, allowing both employee and employer contributions, potentially allowing for higher total contributions than a SEP-IRA.
    - **Traditional IRAs:** Anyone with earned income can contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if 50+). Deductibility depends on income and whether you're covered by a workplace plan.
    - **Roth IRAs:** Contributions are not deductible, but **qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free**. Eligibility phases out at higher income levels. It explains the "back-door Roth IRA" strategy for high-income earners.
    - **Annuities:** Insurance company products that offer tax-deferred growth but have higher fees. They should only be considered after maxing out other retirement accounts.
- **Retirement Account Decisions:**
    - **Rollovers:** When leaving a job, you can roll your 401(k) into an IRA. It stresses the importance of a **direct trustee-to-trustee transfer** to avoid mandatory 20% withholding.
    - **Withdrawals:** Generally, withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty, with some exceptions (e.g., disability, first-time homebuyer up to $10,000, qualified higher education expenses). **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** must begin by April 1 of the year after you turn 72.
    - **Beneficiaries:** Naming beneficiaries is crucial. The SECURE Act changed the rules for inherited IRAs, generally requiring most non-spouse beneficiaries to withdraw the entire account within **10 years** of the original owner's death.
    - **Pension Decisions:** For those with traditional pensions, it covers the trade-offs between taking a lump sum or monthly payments, and the various survivor benefit options for married couples (e.g., single life, joint and survivor).
