### Chapter 5: All The Form 1040s: Income Stuff
This chapter begins the line-by-line walkthrough of the main tax form, focusing on how to report your most common types of income on Form 1040 and its variants (1040-SR and 1040-NR).

- **Lines 1-9: Income:** This is the core of the chapter, detailing where to report various income streams:
    - **Line 1 (Wages, Salaries, Tips):** Explains how to use your **Form W-2**, decoding its various boxes (e.g., Box 1 for taxable wages, Box 12 for 401(k) contributions). It warns against common errors like incorrect Social Security numbers.
    - **Line 2a & 2b (Taxable & Tax-Exempt Interest):** Covers reporting interest from bank accounts and bonds, and notes that tax-exempt interest (like from municipal bonds) must still be reported even though it's not taxed, as it affects other calculations.

    - **Lines 5a & 5b (Pensions and Annuities):** Discusses how pensions are taxed, explaining the Simplified Method vs. the General Rule for calculating the taxable portion. It also covers lump-sum distributions.
    - **Lines 6a & 6b (Social Security Benefits):** Explains how to determine the taxable portion of your Social Security benefits using worksheets that factor in your other income.
    - **Line 7 (Capital Gain or Loss):** A brief introduction to Schedule D, used for reporting profits and losses from selling investments.
    - **Line 8 (Other Income):** A catch-all line that points to Schedule 1 for reporting less common income like bartering, gambling winnings, or canceled debt.
