### Chapter 13: Business Tax Schedules: C and F
This chapter covers the tax schedules for self-employed individuals (Schedule C) and farmers (Schedule F). It's a comprehensive guide to reporting business income and expenses.

- **Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business):** Used by sole proprietors and single-member LLCs.
    - **Part I: Income:** You report your gross receipts, returns/allowances, and cost of goods sold (using inventory accounting methods like FIFO/LIFO) to arrive at gross income.
    - **Part II: Expenses:** This is where you deduct business costs. Major categories include:
        - **Advertising, Car & Truck Expenses, Commissions, Contract Labor, Depletion, Employee Benefits, Insurance, Interest, Legal/Professional Services, Office Expenses, Rent, Repairs, Supplies, Taxes & Licenses, Travel & Meals, Utilities, and Wages.**
        - **Car & Truck Expenses:** You can deduct actual expenses (gas, repairs, insurance) or use the **standard mileage rate** (56 cents per mile for 2021). Commuting costs between home and a regular office are not deductible.
        - **Depreciation (Line 13):** A major section explaining how to recover the cost of business assets (computers, equipment, vehicles) over time. It covers **Section 179 expensing** (deducting up to $1,050,000 of new/used equipment immediately) and **bonus depreciation**. It also explains the complex "luxury car" rules that limit depreciation deductions for vehicles.
        - **Travel & Meals (Lines 24a-b):** Only 50% of business meal expenses are normally deductible. It details the rules for deducting travel expenses when away from your "tax home," including the special per diem rates for meals.
    - **Home Office Deduction (Line 30):** Introduces Form 8829, used to claim a deduction for the business use of your home. The space must be used regularly and exclusively for business.
    - **Hobby Loss Rule:** A warning that if your business doesn't show a profit in at least three of five consecutive years, the IRS may reclassify it as a hobby and disallow your losses.
- **Schedule F (Profit or Loss from Farming):** Similar to Schedule C but with agriculture-specific categories.
    - It covers farm income (sales of livestock, produce, etc.) and farm-specific expenses like chemicals, conservation expenses, custom hire (machine work), and farm labor.
    - It explains special rules for farmers, including the option to use income averaging (Schedule J) and the optional method for calculating self-employment tax to gain Social Security credit.

### Chapter 14: Capital Gains and Losses: Schedule D and Form 8949
This chapter explains how to report profits and losses from the sale of capital assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate (other than your primary home). This is where the difference between short-term and long-term holding periods matters most.

- **Form 8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets):** This is the detailed worksheet where you list every individual sale. Transactions are categorized based on whether they are short-term or long-term, and whether the basis was reported to the IRS.
- **Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses):** The summary schedule where you transfer the totals from your Forms 8949.
    - **Part I (Short-Term):** For assets held one year or less. Gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.
    - **Part II (Long-Term):** For assets held more than 12 months. Gains are taxed at preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20% in 2021).
- **Calculating Your Basis:** A crucial section explaining how to determine your cost basis, which is the starting point for calculating gain or loss.
    - It covers rules for purchased property, inherited property (basis is stepped up to date-of-death value), and gifted property.
    - It explains how adjustments (like stock splits, dividends reinvested, and improvements to a rental property) can increase or decrease your basis.
- **Sale of Your Home:** Details the generous tax break allowing single filers to exclude up to **$250,000** of profit and married couples filing jointly to exclude up to **$500,000**. To qualify, you must have owned and used the home as your principal residence for at least two of the five years before the sale.
    - If your profit exceeds the exclusion, the excess is reported on Schedule D.
    - It also covers special rules for military members and those with a home office.
- **Other Stock Matters:** This section covers special situations like:
    - **Wash Sales:** You cannot deduct a loss if you buy the same or a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.
    - **Worthless Securities:** If a stock becomes completely worthless, it is treated as a capital loss on the last day of the tax year.
    - **Stock Options:** Briefly explains the tax treatment of incentive stock options (ISOs) and nonstatutory stock options.
- **Nonbusiness Bad Debts:** If you lend money to a friend or relative and they don't repay, you may be able to deduct it as a short-term capital loss, provided the debt is truly worthless and you can prove it was a legitimate loan, not a gift.
- **Cryptocurrency:** It confirms that for tax purposes, cryptocurrency is treated as property. Therefore, selling or trading crypto generates a capital gain or loss that must be reported on Form 8949 and Schedule D. It also notes that inherited cryptocurrency does not receive a step-up in basis.
