Here is a summary of Chapters 3 and 4 of "Taxes 2022 For Dummies":

### Chapter 3: Getting and Staying Organized
This chapter focuses on the critical importance of good record-keeping for tax purposes, especially in case of an audit. It emphasizes that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer.

*   **Why Keep Good Records?** Without proper documentation, deductions can be disallowed during an audit, leading to additional tax, interest, and penalties. Good organization also saves you money on tax preparer fees.
*   **Setting Up a System:** It recommends simple, practical systems like using an accordion file or labeled manila folders to organize receipts and documents by category (e.g., medical expenses, charitable contributions, investment records) throughout the year.
*   **What to Keep and For How Long:**
    *   **General Rule:** Keep tax records for a minimum of **three years** from the date you filed your return, as this is the standard statute of limitations for an audit.
    *   **Important Exception:** Keep records for assets you still own (like your home, stocks, or improvements to property) indefinitely, as they are needed to calculate your "basis" (cost) when you eventually sell.
*   **Reconstructing Missing Records:** The chapter provides strategies for reconstructing lost records, such as researching old newspaper ads for property values, obtaining historical data from real estate boards, or using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to estimate past values. It offers specific advice for inherited or gifted property.
*   **The Cohan Rule:** It explains the "Cohan Rule," a legal precedent that allows taxpayers to estimate certain small expenses (like tips or taxi fares) if they have a valid reason for not having receipts, though it stresses this is not a substitute for good record-keeping.

### Chapter 4: What Kind of Taxpayer Are You?
This chapter helps you identify your correct filing status and determine who you can claim as a dependent, which are foundational steps before filling out any tax forms.

*   **Which 1040 Form to Use:** It explains the different versions of Form 1040:
    *   **Form 1040:** The standard form for most U.S. taxpayers.
    *   **Form 1040-SR:** For taxpayers age 65 or older, featuring larger print.
    *   **Form 1040-NR:** For nonresident aliens with U.S.-source income.
    *   It also introduces Schedules 1, 2, and 3, which are now used to report additional income, taxes, and credits.
*   **Choosing a Filing Status:** It details the five filing statuses and their impact on your tax rates:
    *   **Single:** For unmarried individuals.
    *   **Married Filing Jointly:** For married couples, generally the most beneficial rate.
    *   **Married Filing Separately:** A less common option that may be beneficial in specific situations, such as separating finances or claiming certain itemized deductions.
    *   **Head of Household:** For unmarried individuals who pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for a qualifying person (like a child or parent).
    *   **Qualifying Widow(er) with Dependent Child:** A special status available for up to two years after a spouse's death, allowing the use of joint return tax rates.
*   **Counting Your Dependents:** It provides the rules for claiming someone as a dependent, distinguishing between a **"qualifying child"** (relationship, age, residency, and support tests) and a **"qualifying relative"** (member of household/relation, gross income, and support tests). It also covers special rules for children of divorced or separated parents.
*   **Filing Basics:** The chapter concludes with essential information on **when to file** (the deadline and how to get an extension), **where to file**, and **how to file** (paper vs. electronic). It stresses the importance of filing on time even if you can't pay, to avoid steeper penalties.
