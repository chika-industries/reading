### Chapter 27: Estate Planning
This chapter covers the often-overlooked topic of estate planning, explaining how to minimize taxes on the wealth you pass on to your heirs.

- **Do You Owe Estate Taxes?** For 2021, the federal estate tax exemption is **$11.7 million per individual** ($23.4 million for a married couple with proper planning). This means most people do not owe federal estate tax. However, some states have their own estate or inheritance taxes with much lower exemption thresholds (e.g., $1 million in Massachusetts and Oregon).
- **Determining Your Taxable Estate:** Your estate includes all assets you own at death: real estate, investments (including retirement accounts), life insurance proceeds, and personal property, minus any liabilities.
- **Strategies to Reduce Estate Taxes:**
    - **Gifting:** You can give up to **$15,000 per year** to as many individuals as you like without triggering gift taxes or using up your lifetime exemption. This removes the money (and future appreciation) from your estate.
    - **Unlimited Marital Deduction:** You can leave an unlimited amount of assets to your spouse tax-free. However, this can concentrate the wealth in the surviving spouse's estate, potentially creating a tax problem later.
    - **Bypass Trust (Credit Shelter Trust):** A common strategy for married couples. Upon the first death, assets up to the exemption amount are placed in a trust. The surviving spouse can benefit from the trust during their life, but the assets are not included in their estate when they die, thus preserving both spouses' exemptions.
    - **Charitable Trusts:** Strategies like Charitable Remainder Trusts allow you to donate assets to charity, receive an income stream for life, and get a current income tax deduction, while also removing the assets from your estate.
- **Wills and Trusts:**
    - **Will:** A legal document stating your wishes for asset distribution and naming guardians for minor children. Without a will, state law decides these matters.
    - **Living Trust (Revocable Trust):** Allows your assets to pass to your heirs without going through probate, which can be time-consuming and expensive. It does not, by itself, save on estate taxes.
- **Life Insurance:** Cash-value life insurance is often oversold as an estate planning tool. While it can provide liquidity to pay estate taxes, it's expensive. The death benefit can be removed from your estate if the policy is owned by an **irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT)** .
- **Getting Advice:** It recommends seeking objective advice from attorneys or tax advisors who specialize in estate planning and do not sell insurance or investment products.

### Part 6: The Part of Tens

#### Chapter 28: Ten Tips for Reducing Your Chances of Being Audited
This chapter offers practical, common-sense advice to minimize your audit risk.

1.  **Double-Check Your Return for Accuracy:** Math errors and mismatched numbers are red flags.
2.  **Declare All Your Income:** The IRS receives copies of your W-2s and 1099s; unreported income is easily caught.
3.  **Don't Itemize (If You Can't Support It):** Itemized deductions face more scrutiny than the standard deduction.
4.  **Earn Less Money:** Higher incomes statistically have higher audit rates.
5.  **Don't Cheat or Protest:** Fraudulent returns and frivolous protest letters draw attention.
6.  **Avoid Back-Street Refund Mills:** Unscrupulous preparers who fabricate deductions can trigger audits for all their clients.
7.  **Be Careful with Hobby Losses:** A sideline business that shows a loss year after year may be reclassified as a hobby.
8.  **Don't Be a Nonfiler:** The IRS actively pursues nonfilers, leading to back taxes, penalties, and potential prosecution.
9.  **Don't Cut Corners if You're Self-Employed:** Self-employed returns are audited at a higher rate, so be honest and accurate.
10. **Carry a Rabbit's Foot:** Some audits are purely random, so sometimes it's just bad luck.

#### Chapter 29: Ten Overlooked Opportunities to Trim Your Taxes
This chapter highlights often-missed tax-saving strategies.

1.  **Make Your Savings Work for You:** Use high-yield money market funds instead of low-interest bank accounts.
2.  **Invest in Wealth-Building Assets:** Focus on long-term investments like stocks and real estate, which are tax-favored.
3.  **Fund "Tax-Reduction" Accounts:** Maximize contributions to 401(k)s, IRAs, and HSAs.
4.  **Use a "Back-Door" Roth IRA:** A strategy for high-income earners to contribute to a Roth IRA.
5.  **Work Overseas:** U.S. citizens working abroad may be able to exclude over $100,000 of foreign earnings from U.S. tax.
6.  **Check Whether You Can Itemize:** Don't assume you can't; your total deductible expenses (taxes, mortgage interest, charity) might exceed the standard deduction.
7.  **Trade Consumer Debt for Mortgage Debt:** Refinancing high-interest, non-deductible debt into lower-interest, potentially deductible mortgage debt can save money.
8.  **Consider Charitable Contributions and Expenses:** Remember to deduct out-of-pocket expenses for volunteer work and the fair market value of donated goods.
9.  **Scour for Self-Employment Expenses:** Review all potential business deductions, including home office, car expenses, and continuing education.
10. **Read This Book, Use Tax Software, Hire a Tax Advisor:** Investing in your tax knowledge or professional help pays for itself.

#### Chapter 30: Ten (Plus One) Tax Tips for Military Families
This chapter summarizes special tax benefits available to members of the U.S. Armed Forces.

1.  **Some Military Wages May Be Tax-Exempt:** Combat pay is generally tax-free, and many allowances (housing, subsistence, moving) are also excluded from income.
2.  **Rule Adjustments to Home Sales:** The two-year residency requirement for the home sale exclusion can be suspended during periods of qualified military service.
3.  **Tax Benefits for Your Family if You're Killed in Action:** Income tax liability may be forgiven for the year of death and prior years served in a combat zone.
4.  **Deadlines Extended During Combat Service:** Tax filing and payment deadlines are automatically extended for those serving in a combat zone.
5.  **Income Tax Payment Deferment:** Active-duty service members can defer paying income taxes that were due before or during their service period.
6.  **Travel Expense Deductions for National Guard and Reserves:** Unreimbursed travel expenses for drills or meetings more than 100 miles from home are deductible.
7.  **No Early Retirement Distribution Penalty for Called Reservists:** Reservists called to active duty can withdraw from retirement accounts without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.
8.  **No Education Account Distribution Penalty for Military Academy Students:** Distributions from 529 plans or ESAs for students at military academies are not subject to the 10% penalty, even if not used for tuition.
9.  **Military Base Realignment and Closure Benefits Are Excludable:** Moving and housing allowances related to base closures are generally not taxable.
10. **State Income Tax Flexibility for Spouses:** The Military Spouses Residency Relief Act allows military spouses to choose the same state of residency as the service member for tax purposes.
11. **Deductibility of Some Expenses When Returning to Civilian Life:** Job search and moving expenses when leaving the military may be deductible.

#### Chapter 31: Ten Interview Questions for Tax Advisors
This chapter provides a list of essential questions to ask when vetting a potential tax preparer or advisor.

1.  **What Tax Services Do You Offer?** Do they just prepare returns, or do they offer planning and advice?
2.  **Do You Have Areas You Focus On?** Look for an advisor with expertise in your specific situation (e.g., small business, rental property).
3.  **What Other Services Do You Offer?** Be wary of advisors who also sell investment or insurance products, as this creates a conflict of interest.
4.  **Who Will Prepare My Return?** Will the person you're interviewing do the work, or will it be delegated to a junior associate?
5.  **How Aggressive or Conservative Are You Regarding the Tax Law?** Find someone whose risk tolerance aligns with your own.
6.  **What's Your Experience with Audits?** A good advisor should have audit experience and be able to represent you.
7.  **How Does Your Fee Structure Work?** Clarify whether they charge by the hour or a flat fee, and what services are included.
8.  **What Qualifies You to Be a Tax Advisor?** Inquire about their credentials (CPA, EA, attorney), experience, and continuing education.
9.  **Do You Carry Liability Insurance?** This protects you if the advisor makes a costly error.
10. **Can You Provide References of Clients Similar to Me?** Speaking with current clients in a similar situation can provide valuable insights.

That covers all 31 chapters of "Taxes 2022 For Dummies." I hope these summaries have been helpful!
