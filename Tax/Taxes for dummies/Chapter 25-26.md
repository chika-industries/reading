### Chapter 25: Real Estate and Taxes
This chapter covers the significant tax benefits available to real estate owners, from primary residences to investment properties, and provides guidance on making tax-wise real estate decisions.

- **Tax Breaks for Homeowners:**
    - **Mortgage Interest Deduction:** You can deduct interest on up to **$750,000** of mortgage debt ($1 million for loans taken out before December 16, 2017) used to buy, build, or improve your first and second homes.
    - **Property Tax Deduction:** State and local property taxes are deductible as part of the itemized deduction on Schedule A, subject to the overall **$10,000 SALT cap** ($5,000 for married filing separately).
    - **Home Sale Gain Exclusion:** One of the most valuable tax breaks. You can exclude up to **$250,000** of profit ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly) from the sale of your primary residence, provided you have owned and lived in it for at least two of the five years before the sale.
    - **Home Office Deduction:** If you use part of your home regularly and exclusively for business, you may be able to deduct a portion of your housing expenses.
- **Purchasing a Home:**
    - It advises against buying a home if you plan to move within a few years, as transaction costs can wipe out any gains.
    - It emphasizes the importance of tracking your home's **basis** (original cost plus improvements). Keeping receipts for improvements (e.g., room additions, new roof, landscaping) can significantly reduce your taxable gain when you sell.
    - If you rent out your home for **14 days or less** per year, the rental income is tax-free.
- **Mortgage Decisions:**
    - **15-Year vs. 30-Year Mortgage:** Paying off a mortgage faster (15-year) saves interest but reduces liquidity. A 30-year mortgage frees up cash that could be invested in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which may be a better long-term strategy.
    - **Refinancing:** Before refinancing, calculate the true after-tax savings by factoring in the lost mortgage interest deduction. You can generally deduct points paid on a refinance over the life of the loan, not all at once.
- **Rental Property and Real Estate Investing:**
    - **Operating Expenses:** You can deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses for managing and maintaining a rental property, including insurance, repairs, utilities, and property management fees.
    - **Depreciation:** A key benefit. Residential rental property is depreciated over **27.5 years**, allowing you to deduct a portion of the building's cost each year against your rental income, even though the property may be appreciating in value.
    - **Passive Loss Rules:** Losses from rental activities are generally "passive" and can only offset passive income. However, there is a special **$25,000 loss allowance** for taxpayers who "actively participate" in managing the property, which phases out between $100,000 and $150,000 of AGI.
    - **1031 Exchanges:** Allows you to defer paying capital gains tax on the sale of an investment property by using the proceeds to purchase a "like-kind" replacement property.

### Chapter 26: Children and Taxes
This chapter addresses the tax implications of raising children, from birth through college, and provides strategies for minimizing taxes and maximizing financial aid.

- **Child-Related Tax Benefits:**
    - **Dependency Exemption:** While the personal exemption amount is $0 for 2018-2025 due to the TCJA, claiming a child as a dependent is still crucial for qualifying for other credits.
    - **Child Tax Credit:** For 2021 only, the credit was expanded to **$3,600 per child under age 6** and **$3,000 per child ages 6-17**. It is also fully refundable.
    - **Child and Dependent Care Credit:** Helps offset the cost of childcare so parents can work. For 2021, it was expanded to up to **50%** of qualifying expenses, with a maximum credit of **$4,000 for one child** and **$8,000 for two or more**.
    - **Adoption Credit:** A nonrefundable credit for qualified adoption expenses, up to **$14,440** per child in 2021.
- **Education Tax Breaks and Pitfalls:**
    - **Kiddie Tax:** Unearned income (e.g., interest, dividends) over **$2,200** for a child under 19 (or under 24 if a full-time student) is taxed at the parents' higher tax rate, not the child's rate. This discourages shifting large investment portfolios to children.
    - **Financial Aid "Tax":** The chapter reveals a hidden cost of saving in a child's name. The financial aid formula counts student assets much more heavily than parent assets. Money in a child's name can significantly reduce eligibility for need-based aid.
    - **Section 529 Plans:** State-sponsored education savings plans. Contributions are not deductible federally, but earnings grow **tax-free** and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are also **tax-free**. Assets in a 529 plan are treated as a parent asset for FAFSA purposes, which is better than a custodial account.
    - **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs):** Also known as Coverdell ESAs, allow after-tax contributions of up to $2,000 per year, with tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified K-12 and college expenses. Income limits apply.
    - **American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits:** Reiterates the rules for these education tax credits.
    - **U.S. Savings Bonds (Series EE/I):** Interest may be tax-free if used for qualified higher education expenses, subject to income limits.
- **Investment Accounts for Children:**
    - It generally advises **against** putting money in a child's name (custodial accounts) unless you are wealthy enough to not qualify for financial aid. The "kiddie tax" and negative financial aid impact often outweigh any minor tax savings.
    - If you do invest for a child, it recommends tax-friendly investments like growth stocks or stock index funds that don't generate much current income.
