### Chapter 23: Small-Business Tax Planning
This chapter is dedicated to tax strategies for small business owners, covering everything from record-keeping to retirement plans and the decision to incorporate.

- **Organizing Your Business Accounting:**
    - **Leave an Audit Trail:** Keep meticulous records of both income and expenses. Using separate business bank accounts and credit cards is essential.
    - **Stay Current on Taxes:** Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments (Form 1040-ES). If you have employees, you must withhold and pay payroll taxes (Social Security, Medicare, unemployment) on time.
    - **Hobby Loss Rules:** A reminder that if your business doesn't show a profit in at least three of five consecutive years, the IRS may reclassify it as a hobby and disallow your losses.
- **Minimizing Your Small-Business Taxes:**
    - **The 20% Pass-Through Deduction (Section 199A):** Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations may be eligible to deduct up to **20% of their qualified business income** (QBI). This deduction phases out for higher-income service providers (e.g., doctors, lawyers, consultants).
    - **Depreciation vs. Deduction:** Explains the benefits of **Section 179**, which allows you to immediately deduct the full cost of qualifying equipment (up to $1,050,000 in 2021), rather than depreciating it over several years. **Bonus depreciation** (100% for 2021) is also available for new and used property.
    - **Car Costs:** You can deduct actual expenses or use the standard mileage rate (56 cents/mile for 2021). It warns against buying expensive cars, as depreciation deductions are limited by "luxury car" rules.
    - **Travel, Meal, and Entertainment Expenses:** Only **50% of business meals** are normally deductible. For 2021 and 2022 only, meals from restaurants are **100% deductible**. Entertainment expenses (e.g., sporting events, clubs) are generally **not deductible**.
    - **Home Office Deduction:** You can deduct expenses for the part of your home used regularly and exclusively for business, using either the regular method (Form 8829) or the simplified method ($5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft).
    - **Retirement Plans:** Self-employed individuals can use **SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, or Solo 401(k)s** to make significant tax-deductible retirement contributions.
- **Incorporation Decisions:** The chapter weighs the pros and cons of different business structures:
    - **Sole Proprietorship:** Simplest, but no liability protection.
    - **LLC (Limited Liability Company):** Offers liability protection without the double taxation of a C-corp. Profits pass through to the owner's personal tax return.
    - **S Corporation:** Also offers liability protection and pass-through taxation, but with stricter rules. Can save on self-employment taxes if you pay yourself a reasonable salary.
    - **C Corporation:** A separate taxable entity, now with a flat 21% corporate tax rate. May be suitable for businesses that want to retain earnings or attract venture capital.

### Chapter 24: Your Investments and Taxes
This chapter focuses on how to structure your investment portfolio to minimize taxes, particularly for assets held outside of retirement accounts.

- **Tax-Reducing Investment Techniques:**
    - **Buy and Hold for Long-Term Gains:** Assets held for **more than one year** qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20% in 2021, depending on income). Short-term gains are taxed at your higher ordinary income rate.
    - **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:** Paying off credit card debt (which is not tax-deductible) provides a guaranteed, tax-free return equal to the interest rate you're paying.
    - **Fund Retirement Accounts:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
    - **Use Tax-Friendly Investments:**
        - **Tax-Free Money Market and Bond Funds:** Suitable for high-bracket investors.
        - **Index Funds and ETFs:** These tend to trade less frequently than actively managed funds, resulting in fewer taxable capital gains distributions.
- **Tax-Favored Investments to Avoid:** Warns against products often pitched for their tax benefits, such as **limited partnerships** (high fees, illiquid) and **cash-value life insurance** (expensive, better to use retirement accounts first).
- **Annuities:** Explains that while annuities offer tax-deferred growth, they have high fees and should only be considered **after** maxing out all other retirement accounts. Earnings are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, not at lower capital gains rates.
- **Selling Decisions:**
    - **Selling Selected Shares:** If you only sell a portion of your holdings in a stock or fund, you can **specify which shares** to sell (e.g., the highest-cost shares) to minimize your taxable gain. If you don't specify, the IRS forces you to use FIFO (first-in, first-out).
    - **Selling at a Loss:** You can use capital losses to offset capital gains. If losses exceed gains, you can deduct up to **$3,000** of net loss against ordinary income per year ($1,500 if married filing separately). Excess losses are carried forward.
    - **Wash Sale Rule:** You cannot deduct a loss if you buy the same or a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.
    - **Mutual Fund Average Cost Method:** Explains the allowed method for calculating gain or loss on mutual fund shares bought at different times and prices.
    - **Stock Options:** Briefly touches on the tax treatment of **incentive stock options (ISOs)** and **nonstatutory stock options**.
