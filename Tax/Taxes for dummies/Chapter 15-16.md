### Chapter 15: Supplemental Income and Loss: Schedule E
This chapter covers Schedule E, the form used to report income (or loss) from rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts.

- **Part I: Income or Loss from Rental Real Estate and Royalties:**
    - **Reporting Basics:** You report income from rents and royalties (typically from Form 1099-MISC). You then deduct related expenses to arrive at your net income or loss.
    - **Deductible Expenses:** Common expenses include advertising, auto/travel, cleaning/maintenance, commissions, insurance, legal/professional fees, management fees, mortgage interest, repairs, supplies, taxes, utilities, and **depreciation**.
    - **Depreciation:** A key tax benefit for rental property. Residential rental property is depreciated over **27.5 years**, while nonresidential property is depreciated over 39 years. Only the value of the building (not the land) can be depreciated.
    - **Vacation Homes:** Special rules apply if you both rent out a property and use it personally.
        - If you rent it for **fewer than 15 days**, you don't have to report the rental income, but you also can't deduct rental expenses.
        - If you use it **more than 14 days or 10% of the rental days**, the property is considered a personal residence, and your rental expense deduction is limited to the amount of rental income (you can't claim a loss).
    - **Passive Activity Loss Rules:** Rental real estate is generally considered a "passive activity." Losses from passive activities can only be used to offset income from other passive activities, not your regular wages or salary.
    - **The $25,000 Special Allowance:** An important exception allows you to deduct up to **$25,000** in rental real estate losses against your ordinary income if you "actively participate" in managing the property. This allowance phases out for taxpayers with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) between $100,000 and $150,000.
- **Parts II-IV (Partnerships, S Corps, Estates, Trusts):**
    - These sections cover income from pass-through entities, which is reported to you on a **Schedule K-1**.
    - You must report your share of the entity's income or loss, and the character of the income (e.g., ordinary income, rental income, interest) maintains its identity on your return.
    - The at-risk and basis limitation rules limit your loss deductions to the amount you have personally invested in the entity.

### Chapter 16: Giving Credits Where Credits Are Due
This chapter provides an overview of various tax credits, which are powerful because they reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar, unlike deductions which only reduce taxable income.

- **Child and Dependent Care Credit (Form 2441):**
    - This credit helps offset the cost of care for a child under 13 or a disabled dependent, allowing you to work or look for work.
    - For 2021 only, the American Rescue Plan Act made this credit much more generous and fully refundable for many taxpayers. The maximum credit is up to **50%** of qualifying expenses, with a limit of **$4,000 for one qualifying person** and **$8,000 for two or more**.
    - It phases out for higher-income taxpayers (AGI over $438,000).
- **Credit for the Elderly or Disabled (Schedule R):**
    - A credit for lower-income taxpayers who are 65 or older, or who are permanently and totally disabled.
    - Due to strict income limits, very few people qualify for this credit.
- **Education Credits (Form 8863):**
    - **American Opportunity Credit:** Worth up to **$2,500** per student for the first four years of college. It is partially refundable (up to $1,000).
    - **Lifetime Learning Credit:** Worth up to **$2,000** per tax return (not per student) for undergraduate, graduate, or job-skill courses. It has no limit on the number of years you can claim it.
    - Both credits have income phase-outs and cannot be claimed for the same student in the same year.
- **Child Tax Credit:**
    - For 2021 only, this credit was significantly expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act. It increased to **$3,600 per child under age 6** and **$3,000 per child ages 6 through 17**. It was also made fully refundable.
    - Advance payments of half the credit were sent to eligible taxpayers starting in July 2021. This chapter warns that if you received advance payments but ultimately don't qualify based on your 2021 income, you may have to repay the excess on your tax return.
- **Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Form 8880):**
    - Also known as the "Saver's Credit," this is for low-to-moderate-income taxpayers who make contributions to a retirement account like an IRA or 401(k).
- **Residential Energy Credits (Form 5695):**
    - **Nonbusiness Energy Property Credit:** A credit for energy-efficient improvements like insulation, windows, and doors (subject to a $500 lifetime limit).
    - **Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit:** A credit for renewable energy systems like solar panels, solar water heaters, and geothermal heat pumps. For 2021, this is **26%** of the cost, with no dollar limit.
- **Adoption Credit (Form 8839):**
    - A nonrefundable credit for qualified adoption expenses, up to **$14,440** per child in 2021.
- **Earned Income Credit (EIC):**
    - A refundable credit for low-to-moderate-income working individuals and families. The amount depends on your income, filing status, and number of qualifying children. The chapter provides the 2021 income limits for qualification.
