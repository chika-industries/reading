### Chapter 17: Other Schedules and Forms to File
This chapter covers a variety of additional tax forms that taxpayers may need to file depending on their specific situations.

- **Form 1040-ES (Estimated Tax for Individuals):** For those who don't have enough tax withheld from their paychecks (e.g., self-employed individuals, retirees, investors), this form is used to calculate and pay quarterly estimated taxes. The "Safe Harbor" rule allows you to avoid penalties by paying 100% (or 110% for high-income earners) of your prior year's tax liability.
- **Form 3903 (Moving Expenses):** As noted in Chapter 7, this deduction is now only available for **active-duty members of the Armed Forces** who move due to a military order. It explains how to calculate deductible moving and storage costs.
- **Form 8606 (Nondeductible IRAs):** This form is required if you make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA or convert amounts from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. It helps track your "basis" (after-tax money) in your IRAs so you don't pay tax on it again when you withdraw.
- **Forms 8615 and 8814 (The Kiddie Tax):**
    - **Form 8615:** Used when a child under age 19 (or under 24 if a full-time student) has investment income over $2,200 and must file their own tax return. It calculates the tax on the excess at the parents' higher tax rate.
    - **Form 8814:** Allows parents to elect to report their child's interest and dividend income (up to $11,000) on their own return instead of filing a separate return for the child.
- **Form 8829 (Expenses for Business Use of Your Home):** A detailed form for calculating the home office deduction using the "regular method" (based on actual expenses and square footage). It also mentions the "simplified method," which allows a deduction of $5 per square foot (up to 300 square feet, for a maximum of $1,500).
- **Form W-4 (Employee Withholding):** Used to adjust the amount of federal income tax withheld from your paycheck. The IRS provides an online "Tax Withholding Estimator" to help you get it right.
- **Schedule H (Household Employment Taxes):** The "nanny tax" form. If you pay a household employee (like a nanny or housekeeper) cash wages of **$2,300 or more** in 2021, you may need to pay Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment (FUTA) taxes.
- **Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax):** Used to calculate the Social Security and Medicare tax owed on net self-employment income of $400 or more. The rate is **15.3%** on the first $142,800 of earnings, plus **2.9%** on any excess.

### Chapter 18: Dreaded Envelopes: IRS Notices, Assessments, and Audits
This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to dealing with IRS correspondence, from routine notices to full-blown audits.

- **The IRS Notice Process:** It explains the typical timeline of IRS collection notices, starting with a balance-due notice (CP series), followed by increasingly urgent warnings (CP-503, CP-504), and culminating in a **Final Notice of Intent to Levy**. It stresses the importance of responding promptly.
- **Types of Notices:**
    - **CP-2000 (Notice of Proposed Adjustment):** Issued when income reported to the IRS (on W-2s, 1099s) doesn't match what you reported on your return. It assumes the third-party information is correct and proposes additional tax.
    - **CP-2501 (Income Verification Notice):** Similar to CP-2000 but often a preliminary request for more information.
    - **CP-515/CP-518 (Request for Tax Return):** Notices sent to non-filers, demanding that a return be filed.
    - **Federal Tax Lien Notice (Form 668(F)):** A public notice that the IRS has a claim against your property. This can severely damage your credit.
    - **Levy Notices (Form 668-A(c), 668-W(c)):** Notices that the IRS intends to seize your property (including bank accounts) or garnish your wages to satisfy your tax debt.
- **The Four Types of Audits:**
    - **Correspondence Audit:** Conducted entirely by mail, usually focused on specific items like deductions or credits.
    - **Office Audit:** Conducted at an IRS office, typically for individual returns with issues like itemized deductions or business expenses.
    - **Field Audit:** Conducted at your home or place of business, usually for more complex returns, such as those with a Schedule C.
    - **Random Statistical Audit:** A random selection used by the IRS to gather data on taxpayer compliance.
- **Preparing for an Audit:** The chapter advises gathering all relevant documentation, organizing it neatly, and sticking to the specific items being questioned. It notes that you have the right to be represented by a tax professional (enrolled agent, CPA, or attorney).
- **Statute of Limitations on Audits:** The IRS generally has **three years** from the due date of your return to assess additional tax. This period extends to six years if you omitted more than 25% of your gross income. There is no time limit for fraudulent returns or failure to file.
