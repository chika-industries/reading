### Chapter 7: Form 1040, Schedule 1, Part II: Adjustments to Income Stuff
This chapter covers Part II of Schedule 1, which is dedicated to "above-the-line" deductions. These are adjustments to income that you can take regardless of whether you itemize your deductions on Schedule A.

- **Line 11 (Educator Expenses):** Teachers and other eligible educators can deduct up to $250 ($500 if married filing jointly and both are educators) of unreimbursed expenses for classroom supplies, including COVID-19 protective items.
- **Line 12 (Certain Business Expenses):** This line is for specific groups like Armed Forces reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials to deduct their employee business expenses.
- **Line 13 (Health Savings Account (HSA) Deduction):** Explains how HSAs work for those with high-deductible health plans. Contributions are tax-deductible, grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. The deduction is calculated on Form 8889.
- **Line 14 (Moving Expenses):** Notes that the moving expense deduction is now only available for **active-duty members of the Armed Forces** who move due to a military order.
- **Line 15 (One-Half of Self-Employment Tax):** Self-employed individuals pay both the employee and employer share of Social Security and Medicare tax. They are allowed to deduct the employer-equivalent portion (half of the total) as an adjustment to income.
- **Line 16 (Self-Employed SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans):** This is where self-employed people deduct contributions to their own retirement plans, such as SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and solo 401(k)s. It explains the contribution limits and rules for these plans.
- **Line 17 (Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction):** Self-employed individuals can deduct 100% of the health insurance premiums paid for themselves, their spouse, and their dependents.
- **Line 18 (Penalty on Early Withdrawal of Savings):** The penalty you pay for withdrawing a certificate of deposit (CD) early is deductible here.
- **Lines 19a-c (Alimony Paid):** This mirrors the rule from Chapter 6: for divorce agreements executed **after December 31, 2018**, alimony paid is **not** deductible by the payer. It details what counts as alimony and the strict rules surrounding it.
- **Line 20 (IRA Deduction):** A major section explaining the rules for deducting contributions to a traditional IRA. Deductibility depends on your income, filing status, and whether you (or your spouse) are covered by a retirement plan at work. It introduces the "back-door" Roth IRA strategy for high-income earners.
- **Line 21 (Student Loan Interest Deduction):** You may be able to deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on qualified student loans, subject to income limits.
- **Line 24 (Other Adjustments):** This section covers various other adjustments, including jury duty pay turned over to an employer, the non-taxable amount of Olympic medals, and attorney fees related to unlawful discrimination claims.

### Chapter 8: Form 1040, Schedule 2: Additional Taxes
This chapter focuses on Schedule 2, where you report taxes beyond your standard income tax, such as the AMT and self-employment tax. It's divided into two parts.

- **Schedule 2, Part I: Tax:**
    - **Line 1 (Alternative Minimum Tax):** Explains the AMT as a parallel tax system that disallows certain deductions. It requires you to calculate your tax two ways and pay the higher amount. The chapter provides the 2021 exemption amounts and phase-out levels.
    - **Line 2 (Excess Advance Premium Tax Credit Repayment):** Covers Form 8962, used to reconcile premium tax credits received through the Health Insurance Marketplace. If your 2021 income was higher than estimated, you may have to repay a portion of the credit.
- **Schedule 2, Part II: Other Taxes:**
    - **Line 4 (Self-Employment Tax):** Directs you to Schedule SE to calculate the Social Security and Medicare tax owed on your net self-employment income.
    - **Line 8 (Additional Tax on IRAs or Other Tax-Favored Accounts):** This line is for penalties calculated on Form 5329, such as the 10% penalty for early withdrawals from an IRA or the 50% penalty for failing to take a required minimum distribution.
    - **Line 11 (Additional Medicare Tax):** Explains the 0.9% additional Medicare tax that applies to high earners (individuals with wages over $200,000 and couples over $250,000).
    - **Line 12 (Net Investment Income Tax):** Describes the 3.8% tax on net investment income for high-income taxpayers, calculated on Form 8960. This tax applies to interest, dividends, capital gains, and other passive income.
    - **Line 19 (Excess Advance Child Tax Credit Repayment):** A new line for 2021, addressing the repayment of advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments received by taxpayers who ultimately did not qualify for the full amount based on their 2021 income.
