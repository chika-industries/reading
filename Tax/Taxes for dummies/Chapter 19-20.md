### Chapter 19: Fixing Mistakes the IRS Makes
This chapter is a practical guide for taxpayers who receive an incorrect notice from the IRS. It acknowledges that the IRS makes many errors and provides strategies and template letters for correcting them.

- **Common IRS Mistakes:** The chapter lists frequent errors, including misapplied payments, incorrect Social Security numbers, misattributed income (income belonging to someone else), double-counted income, lost returns, and incorrect 1099 information.
- **How to Respond:** The key principle is to respond promptly and keep your correspondence simple and to the point. Always include your name, Social Security number, the tax year in question, and a copy of the notice (never the original).
- **Generic Response Letter:** The chapter provides a master template letter that can be adapted for various situations. It then offers specific paragraphs to insert for common errors, such as:
    - **Misapplied Payments:** Provide proof of payment (e.g., a copy of a canceled check).
    - **Incorrect 1099:** Explain that the 1099 is wrong and include a copy of a corrected one.
    - **Lost Return:** State that the return was timely filed and include proof of mailing (e.g., certified mail receipt).
    - **Incorrectly Assessed Penalties:** Explain the reason the penalty should be waived (e.g., valid extension, first-time abatement).
- **When the IRS Ignores You:** If you don't get a response after 30 days, the chapter introduces the **Taxpayer Advocate Service**, an independent office within the IRS that helps resolve problems that can't be fixed through normal channels. They can issue a Taxpayer Assistance Order (TAO) to stop collection actions.
- **Finding a Lost Refund:** If your refund is lost or stolen, you can use the IRS's "Where's My Refund?" tool or file **Form 3911 (Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund)** . It also covers rules for interest on late refunds and how to handle refunds for deceased taxpayers.

### Chapter 20: Fixing Your Own Mistakes
This chapter provides guidance for taxpayers who need to correct errors on their own previously filed tax returns or who are having trouble paying their tax bill.

- **Amending a Return (Form 1040X):** If you discover you made a mistake on a return (e.g., forgot a deduction, misreported income), you have **three years** from the original filing date to file an amended return using Form 1040X. It explains common reasons for amending, such as changing filing status or correcting an error.
- **Net Operating Losses (NOLs):** Briefly explains that under current law (post-TCJA), NOLs can generally be carried forward indefinitely, but are limited to 80% of taxable income in any future year. (It notes that special CARES Act rules applied for 2018-2020 losses).
- **If You Can't Pay Your Taxes:** The chapter outlines several options for taxpayers who cannot pay their full balance due, stressing that you should **still file your return on time** even if you can't pay.
    - **Installment Agreement:** You can request to pay your debt in monthly installments using **Form 9465**. The IRS is generally required to approve an agreement if you owe less than $50,000 and can pay it off within 72 months.
    - **Offer in Compromise:** You can attempt to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed by filing **Form 656**. This is only an option if you can demonstrate that paying the full amount would cause financial hardship or if there is doubt as to your liability.
    - **Currently Not Collectible Status:** If you have no assets or income that can be seized, the IRS may temporarily place your account in "currently not collectible" status.
- **Penalties and Interest:**
    - **Abating Penalties:** The IRS may waive penalties if you can show "reasonable cause" (e.g., serious illness, death in the family, reliance on incorrect advice from the IRS). The chapter provides a sample "reasonable cause" letter.
    - **Abating Interest:** Interest is harder to abate, but it may be possible in cases of IRS errors or delays (e.g., the IRS takes over 36 months to assess a deficiency or fails to send a timely bill).
- **Innocent Spouse Relief:** If you filed a joint return and your spouse understated income or claimed improper deductions without your knowledge, you may be eligible for relief from joint liability by filing **Form 8857**. It explains the three types of relief: innocent spouse relief, separation of liability, and equitable relief.
- **Injured Spouse Relief:** This is different from "innocent spouse" relief. If your joint refund was seized to pay your spouse's separate debts (like student loans or child support), you can file **Form 8379 (Injured Spouse Allocation)** to reclaim your portion of the refund.
- **Taxpayer Bill of Rights:** The chapter concludes with an overview of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which includes protections such as the right to be informed, the right to appeal, and the right to finality.
