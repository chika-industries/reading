### Chapter 9: Form 1040, Schedule 3: Adding Up Your Credits and Payments
This chapter covers Schedule 3, which is used to claim various tax credits (which reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar) and report certain payments you've already made.

- **Schedule 3, Part I: Nonrefundable Credits:** These credits can reduce your tax liability to zero, but any excess is not refunded to you.
    - **Line 1 (Foreign Tax Credit):** If you paid taxes to a foreign government on income that is also taxed by the U.S., you can claim a credit (Form 1116) to avoid double taxation.
    - **Line 2 (Child and Dependent Care Credit):** Details the credit for expenses paid for the care of a child under 13 or a disabled dependent, allowing you to work. For 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act made this credit much more valuable and, for the first time, refundable for many.
    - **Line 3 (Education Credits):** Reintroduces the **American Opportunity Credit** and **Lifetime Learning Credit**, which are claimed on Form 8863. It explains the income phase-outs and the rules for who can claim the credit when a student is claimed as a dependent.
    - **Line 4 (Retirement Savings Contribution Credit):** Also known as the "Saver's Credit," this is for low-to-moderate-income earners who contribute to a retirement account like an IRA or 401(k).
    - **Line 5 (Residential Energy Credits):** Covers credits for making energy-efficient improvements to your home, such as installing solar panels (a 26% credit) or adding insulation (subject to a $500 lifetime limit).
    - **Line 6 (Other Nonrefundable Credits):** A catch-all for credits like the Adoption Credit, the Credit for the Elderly or Disabled, and credits for plug-in electric vehicles.
- **Schedule 3, Part II: Other Payments and Refundable Credits:** These are payments you've made or credits that can result in a refund even if you owe no tax.
    - **Line 9 (Net Premium Tax Credit):** The flip-side of the repayment discussed in Chapter 8. If your actual 2021 income was lower than estimated, you may be entitled to an additional premium tax credit.
    - **Line 10 (Amount Paid with Extension):** If you filed for an extension (Form 4868) and paid an estimated amount of tax with that request, you report that payment here.
    - **Line 11 (Excess Social Security and RRTA Tax Withheld):** If you worked for two or more employers and had too much Social Security tax withheld in total (more than the annual maximum), you can claim the excess as a credit.
    - **Line 13 (Other Payments or Refundable Credits):** Includes the refundable portion of the Child and Dependent Care Credit and credits for sick and family leave related to COVID-19 for self-employed individuals.

### Chapter 10: Finishing Up the 1040
This chapter walks you through the final steps of Form 1040, from calculating your taxable income to determining if you owe money or are due a refund.

- **Arriving at Taxable Income:**
    - **Line 11 (Adjusted Gross Income):** Reiterates that this number (AGI) is a key benchmark used throughout the return.
    - **Line 12a (Standard Deduction or Itemized Deductions):** Reminds you to choose the method that gives you the larger deduction. It lists the 2021 standard deduction amounts: $12,550 for single, $18,800 for head of household, and $25,100 for married filing jointly.
    - **Line 12b (Charitable Contributions for Non-Itemizers):** A temporary provision allowing those who take the standard deduction to also deduct up to $300 in cash charitable contributions ($600 for married filing jointly).
    - **Line 13 (Qualified Business Income Deduction):** Briefly introduces this deduction for owners of pass-through businesses (sole proprietors, partners, S-corp shareholders), allowing them to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income.
- **Calculating Your Tax Liability:**
    - **Line 16 (Tax):** This is where you calculate your actual tax. It provides the 2021 tax rate schedules and a worksheet for calculating the tax on **qualified dividends and long-term capital gains**, which are taxed at lower rates (0%, 15%, or 20%).
- **Calculating Your Payments and Refundable Credits:**
    - **Line 25 (Federal Income Tax Withheld):** You enter the total tax withheld from your W-2s and 1099s.
    - **Line 26 (Estimated Tax Payments):** You enter any quarterly estimated tax payments you made during the year.
    - **Line 27a (Earned Income Credit):** The line for claiming this refundable credit for low-to-moderate-income workers.
    - **Line 30 (Recovery Rebate Credit):** A new line for 2021, allowing taxpayers to claim any missing portion of the third round of Economic Impact Payments (stimulus payments) they were entitled to.
- **Refund or Amount You Owe:**
    - **Line 34 (Amount You Overpaid):** If your payments (line 33) are more than your total tax (line 24), you have a refund.
    - **Line 37 (Amount You Owe):** If your total tax is more than your payments, this is the balance due.
    - **Estimated Tax Penalty:** Warns that if you owe more than $1,000 and didn't pay enough tax during the year, you may owe an underpayment penalty, calculated on Form 2210.
