### Chapter 11: Itemized Deductions: Schedule A
This chapter is a deep dive into Schedule A, the form used by taxpayers who choose to itemize their deductions instead of taking the standard deduction.

- **Standard Deduction vs. Itemizing:** It reminds readers that you should only itemize if your total allowable expenses exceed your standard deduction amount. It provides the 2021 standard deduction figures again, with increases for those 65 or older or blind. It also reiterates the special $300/$600 charitable deduction for non-itemizers.
- **Medical and Dental Expenses (Lines 1-4):** You can deduct unreimbursed medical and dental expenses that exceed **7.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** . It provides a comprehensive list of qualifying expenses (e.g., doctor visits, prescriptions, insurance premiums, long-term care, travel for medical care, weight-loss programs for specific diseases) and explicitly lists non-deductible items (e.g., cosmetic surgery, health club dues, over-the-counter medicines).
- **Taxes You Paid (Lines 5-7):** This section covers the deduction for state and local taxes.
    - It includes state and local income taxes (or sales taxes), real estate taxes, and personal property taxes.
    - The key rule for 2021 is the **$10,000 cap ($5,000 for married filing separately)** on the total combined deduction for these taxes (the "SALT" cap).
    - It explains how to handle taxes when buying or selling a home and the tax implications of receiving a property tax refund.
- **Interest You Paid (Lines 8-10):**
    - **Home Mortgage Interest:** You can deduct interest on up to **$750,000** of mortgage debt ($1 million for mortgages taken out before December 16, 2017) used to buy, build, or improve your first and second homes. It explains points, refinancing, and how to use Form 1098.
    - **Investment Interest:** Interest paid on money borrowed to invest (e.g., margin loans) is deductible, but only up to the amount of your net investment income.
- **Gifts to Charity (Lines 11-14):** Deductions are allowed for cash and property given to qualified organizations. The chapter covers record-keeping requirements, the fair market value rule for donated property, limits on deductions (up to 60% of AGI for cash gifts to public charities in 2021), and the special rules for donating cars, boats, and airplanes. It also explains the **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)** rule for those 70½ or older, allowing direct transfers from an IRA to a charity tax-free.
- **Casualty and Theft Losses (Line 15):** For 2021, these losses are only deductible if they result from a **federally declared disaster**. It explains how to calculate the loss, the $100 reduction per event, and the 10%-of-AGI floor.

### Chapter 12: Interest and Dividend Income: Form 1040, Schedule B
This chapter explains Schedule B, which is required if your taxable interest or ordinary dividend income exceeds $1,500.

- **Part I: Interest Income:**
    - It explains how to read **Form 1099-INT** and **Form 1099-OID**, which report taxable interest and original issue discount (like from zero-coupon bonds).
    - It covers the rules for reporting interest from U.S. Savings Bonds (EE and I bonds), including the option to defer reporting interest until the bond is cashed in.
    - It discusses adjustments for bond premiums and market discounts, which can affect your taxable interest and your cost basis in the bond.
    - **Line 3 (U.S. Savings Bond Interest Exclusion):** It explains the rules for excluding interest from Series EE and I bonds if the proceeds are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses, subject to income limits (phase-out begins at $83,200 for singles, $124,800 for joint filers in 2021).
    - It touches on the complex rules for **interest-free loans** and the concept of "imputed interest."
- **Part II: Dividend Income:**
    - It explains **Form 1099-DIV**, distinguishing between **ordinary dividends** (taxed at regular rates) and **qualified dividends** (taxed at the lower capital gains rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%).
    - To be "qualified," the dividends must be paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation, and you must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period surrounding the ex-dividend date.
    - It clarifies that dividends from money market funds, REITs, and tax-exempt corporations do not qualify for the lower rates.
- **Part III: Foreign Accounts and Trusts:**
    - This section contains important questions about foreign financial accounts.
    - **Line 7a:** You must check "Yes" if you had a financial interest in or signature authority over a foreign account. If the total value of all foreign accounts exceeded $10,000, you are required to file a separate **FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR)** electronically.
    - **Line 8:** You must check "Yes" if you are a beneficiary of a foreign trust, which requires filing additional complex forms like Form 3520.
