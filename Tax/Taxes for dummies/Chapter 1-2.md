 Here is a summary of the first two chapters of "Taxes 2022 For Dummies":

### Part 1: Getting Ready to File

#### Chapter 1: Understanding the U.S. Tax System
This chapter introduces the fundamentals of the U.S. income tax system, emphasizing that understanding it is key to legally minimizing your tax burden. It covers:
*   **The System's Purpose:** Taxes fund government services, but the system is also built with incentives to encourage behaviors like home ownership and retirement saving.
*   **The Importance of Year-Round Planning:** A major mistake is only thinking about taxes in April. The chapter uses case studies to show how poor planning or bad advice can lead to costly errors, such as missing retirement account contributions or buying inappropriate financial products.
*   **Understanding Your Tax Rate:** It explains the difference between your **total tax** and your **marginal tax rate** (the rate paid on your last dollar of income). Knowing your marginal rate is crucial for understanding the real value of tax deductions.
*   **State Taxes and the AMT:** It reminds readers that state income taxes add to the overall burden and introduces the **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** as a separate tax system designed to ensure high-income earners pay a minimum amount.
*   **Recent Tax Law Changes:** It summarizes major recent legislation, including the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017** (which lowered rates, increased the standard deduction, and capped the state and local tax deduction) and the **SECURE Act of 2019** (which changed rules for retirement accounts, such as raising the age for required minimum distributions to 72). It also touches on potential future tax changes.

#### Chapter 2: Tax Return Preparation Options and Tools
This chapter guides you through the various methods of preparing your tax return, from doing it yourself to hiring professional help.
*   **Doing It Yourself:** It discusses the pros and cons of preparing your own return, noting it's the cheapest option and a great way to learn about your finances. It warns against relying solely on IRS publications for advice.
*   **Tax Software and Online Resources:** It reviews the benefits of using tax software for accuracy and ease, while cautioning about the "garbage in, garbage out" principle. It also highlights useful internet resources, including the well-organized **IRS website (www.irs.gov)** for forms and account management, and other research sites.
*   **Hiring a Tax Preparer:** This section helps you decide if you need professional help. It details the different types of preparers:
    *   **Unenrolled Preparers:** Generally have the least training (e.g., staff at national chains).
    *   **Enrolled Agents (EAs):** Federally licensed tax specialists who can represent you before the IRS.
    *   **Certified Public Accountants (CPAs):** Accountants with significant training, best for complex financial situations.
    *   **Tax Attorneys:** Highly specialized and expensive, typically used for legal disputes or complex transactions.
*   **Finding an Advisor:** It advises getting referrals from trusted sources and always interviewing at least two or three candidates before hiring.
