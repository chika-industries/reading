### Chapter 23: Choose the Right Tax Advisor and Preparer

This chapter emphasizes that the quality of your tax advisor is the single most important factor in determining how much tax you ultimately pay. The wrong advisor costs you money; the right advisor makes you money.

- **Passion is Key (RULE #21):** The more passionate you and your advisor are about reducing taxes, the lower your taxes will be. A good advisor views the tax law as an opportunity, not something to fear.
- **Education Matters:** Tax preparers range from those with minimal training to those with advanced degrees from top universities. The best advisors have pursued extensive education because they genuinely want to understand the intricacies of the law.
- **Focus on the Future:** Most accountants only look backward, preparing returns based on what already happened. A great tax advisor focuses on the future, creating strategies for *permanent* tax savings rather than just deferring taxes.
- **RULE #22: It's not how much your tax preparer charges you that matters; it's how much your tax preparer costs you.** The author shares an example of a client who saved $70,000 per year in taxes by using his firm. Over 20 years, that's $4 million in savings. The previous, cheaper advisor effectively *cost* the client $4 million by not knowing how to save those taxes.
- **Nonlinear Thinking:** Tax laws are written by creative lawyers and are not straightforward. A good advisor must be a "nonlinear" or right-brained thinker who can see how different sections of the law interact, not just follow a straight line.
- **The Interview Process:** You shouldn't be the one asking all the questions. A great advisor will spend most of the interview *asking you questions* about your situation, dreams, and goals. If they don't ask, they can't possibly tailor a strategy to your specific facts and circumstances.
- **Advisor and Preparer Should Be the Same:** Your tax advisor should also prepare your returns. Otherwise, you risk getting great advice that the preparer doesn't know how to implement correctly on the return.
- **Key Strategy #23:** The final tax strategy provides a list of questions to ask a prospective advisor and a list of questions they should be asking you. A good advisor will want to know about your dreams, your family, your investments, and how you learn best. They should be able to discuss asset protection and give examples of reducing audit risk.

### Chapter 24: What Are You Going to Do With All Your Extra Money?

This chapter answers the question of what to do with the cash flow generated by your new tax strategies. It introduces the three principles of wealth building and shows how tax savings can be used to supercharge them.

- **The Three Foundations of Wealth:**
    1.  **Compound Interest:** Earning interest on your interest. While important, by itself it's a slow way to build wealth.
    2.  **Leverage:** Using other people's money (OPM) to increase your returns. This is what banks do—they borrow money from depositors at low rates and lend it out at higher rates. You can do the same by borrowing from banks to invest in businesses or real estate.
    3.  **Velocity:** The speed at which you re-employ your money. Instead of letting earnings sit idle, you quickly reinvest them and re-leverage them to keep your wealth-building momentum accelerating.
- **The Formula in Action:** The author provides a detailed example showing how these principles work together:
    - **Compound interest alone** on $10,000 earns just over $1,000 in two years.
    - **Adding leverage** (borrowing $100,000) increases two-year earnings to over $13,000.
    - **Adding velocity** (re-leveraging your retained earnings to borrow even more) and **adding tax savings** ($20,000 per year from your new tax strategy) results in over $23,000 in investment earnings in just two years.
- **Start Slow, Then Go Fast:** Just like learning to drive a race car, you need education and practice before you can go fast. Start by learning from experts, take practice runs, and only then pick up speed. The author shares that he is now at "breakneck speed," leveraging not just money but other people's time, talents, and contacts.
- **Key Strategy #24:** The final strategy is to **build massive passive income through your tax savings.** By taking the $20,000 (or more) you save each year from your tax strategy and investing it using the principles of compound interest, leverage, and velocity, you can dramatically accelerate your wealth. The example shows that combining tax savings with leverage and velocity can increase your investment earnings by over 23 times compared to simply putting money in the bank. The ultimate goal is to have your tax advisor also serve as your wealth strategist, integrating both plans into a single, powerful roadmap to financial freedom.
