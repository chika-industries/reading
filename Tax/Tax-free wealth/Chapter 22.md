### Summary of Chapter 22: Don't Fear the Reaper Audit

This chapter aims to eliminate the fear and dread associated with tax audits. The author argues that with proper preparation, the right team, and a solid understanding of the process, an audit is nothing to fear.

- **RULE #19: You can eliminate your fear of a tax audit simply by being prepared.** Auditors are just normal people doing a job. Like bears, they won't attack unless provoked. Being prepared is your best defense.
- **Your Tax Team:** The most important defense is having the right "big game hunter" of a tax advisor to handle the audit for you. Your advisor should be the only person directly dealing with the auditor. A good bookkeeper is also essential to maintain organized records.
- **Preparation - Documentation:**
    - **Accounting Software:** Use good software to record all income and expenses. Maintain both an income statement and a balance sheet. This shows the auditor you run a real business.
    - **Receipts:** Keep receipts for all deductions. For meals, entertainment, and travel, note the business purpose, who you were with, and what was discussed directly on the receipt. Scan receipts or organize them in folders. Keep records for the required period (e.g., 7 years in the U.S., 6 in Canada, 5 in the UK/Australia).
    - **Corporate Books:** Maintain a binder with all corporate records: articles of incorporation, bylaws, operating agreements, and **minutes** of meetings documenting major decisions. A complete corporate book is like a "magic wand" that impresses auditors and speeds up the process.
- **RULE #20: Never try to handle a tax audit yourself. Always enlist the assistance of your tax advisor.** Reasons include:
    - Audits are emotional when it's your own money. Your advisor is professionally detached.
    - Your advisor can control the flow of information, giving the auditor only what is requested, not extra details that could lead to more questions.
    - An experienced advisor knows how to build rapport with auditors, making them more cooperative.
    - The author shares a story of an auditor who was treated poorly by another accountant but opened up and became helpful when treated with respect.
- **Reducing Audit Risk Through Return Preparation:**
    - Your tax return itself can invite or discourage an audit. A skilled preparer knows how to present information to avoid "red flags."
    - **Watch Your Language:** Instead of listing an expense as "seminars" (which attracts attention), consider "continuing education" or "sales/marketing" if those are the true purposes.
    - **Avoid Round Numbers:** If you must estimate, don't use round numbers like $5,000. Use a more precise-looking number like $4,873, which suggests accuracy.
- **Key Strategy #22:** The tax strategy is to **purchase an audit defense plan.** The most expensive part of an audit can be the professional fees to defend it, often costing $10,000-$15,000 or more. An audit defense plan (offered by some tax preparers) covers the cost of representation for that specific return. Just as you insure your car against an unlikely accident, you should insure yourself against the more likely and costly event of an audit. It protects you from the financial burden of defense fees, even if you end up owing no additional tax.
