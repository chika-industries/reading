### Summary of Chapter 18: Business Can Be Your Best Tax Shelter

This chapter makes the case that owning a business is one of the most powerful ways to reduce taxes because governments intentionally use the tax code to incentivize job creation and economic activity.

- **Why Business Gets Tax Breaks:** Governments understand that businesses create jobs, which are essential for a healthy economy. As a result, there are thousands of tax breaks available to businesses and business owners in every developed country.
- **Tax Benefits Throughout the Business Lifecycle:**
    - **Startup Costs:** Expenses incurred before you open your doors (education, travel, professional fees) are not immediately deductible. Once the business opens, these costs become an asset that is amortized (deducted) over several years.
    - **Location Incentives:** Many governments offer "enterprise zone" tax credits for businesses that locate in economically distressed areas. These can include credits for leasing/buying buildings or hiring local employees.
    - **Ongoing Business Expenses:** Once operating, you can deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses, including travel, meals, entertainment, auto expenses, and even some medical expenses with the right structure.
    - **Depreciation and Credits:** Equipment purchases generate depreciation deductions. Many countries also offer investment tax credits for new equipment and research & development expenses.
    - **Employment Incentives:** Governments offer credits for hiring employees, especially those who have been unemployed for long periods or特定 types of workers (like engineers in France). You also deduct all salaries and wages paid.
    - **Stock Options:** You can give employees stock options, deducting their value when exercised. "Incentive stock options" (ISOs) allow employees to pay lower capital gains rates on the profits.
    - **Accounting Method Choices:** Most businesses can choose between the **cash method** (deduct expenses when paid; income when received) and the **accrual method** (deduct when incurred; income when earned). The right choice depends on your specific situation. Businesses can also often choose a fiscal year-end different from the calendar year, offering additional flexibility.
    - **Offshore Planning:** Income from overseas customers can sometimes be sheltered from both home-country and foreign-country taxes with proper planning using specialized advisors.
    - **Selling the Business:** Involving your tax advisor *before* negotiations begins can save enormous taxes. Selling for stock in a public company can defer tax entirely. Even if the business fails, proper planning can turn the loss into an ordinary deduction.
- **Key Strategy #18:** The tax strategy is to **turn your business into a passive investment.** This allows you to use real estate losses (which are passive) to offset business income. The method involves giving a portion of your business to a family member who doesn't work in it. Their share of the business income becomes passive income. If you also give them a share of real estate generating passive losses, those losses can offset their passive business income, sheltering it from tax. This requires careful planning with your advisor.

### Summary of Chapter 19: The Magic of Real Estate

This chapter focuses exclusively on real estate, which the author calls the single best tax shelter in most countries' tax laws. A serious real estate investor should never have to pay tax on cash flow or capital gains.

- **Unmatched Tax Shelter:** Rental real estate is uniquely powerful because it generates "phantom losses" through depreciation. These losses can shelter not only the property's cash flow but also other income (like salary or business profits) from tax.
- **Like-Kind Exchanges (1031 Exchanges):** This is the key to building tax-free wealth in real estate. When you sell a property, you can roll all the proceeds into a new, like-kind property and pay **zero tax** on the gain. You can do this indefinitely, deferring taxes forever and allowing your investments to compound tax-free.
- **Tax Basis and Depreciation:** Every year you take depreciation, your "tax basis" (the cost used to calculate gain on sale) goes down. When you sell, the gain is the difference between the sales price and this low basis. However, a 1031 exchange allows you to avoid recognizing that gain by rolling it into a new property.
- **The Walgreens Example:** The author illustrates a lifetime strategy:
    1.  Start with single-family homes.
    2.  Sell them via 1031 exchange and buy apartment buildings (more cash flow, fewer properties).
    3.  Sell the apartments via 1031 exchange and buy a single, net-leased commercial property (like a Walgreens) where the tenant handles all maintenance.
    Throughout this process, depreciation shelters all cash flow. When you sell, you pay tax. **But if you hold the property until you die, the capital gains tax is eliminated forever.** Your heirs receive a "step-up in basis" to the property's value at your death, wiping out all the accumulated depreciation and gain. You got the tax benefits during your life, and your heirs pay no income tax on the gain.
- **Refinancing is Tax-Free:** One of the biggest benefits of real estate is that loans are not taxable. If you need cash, you can refinance a property and take money out tax-free, rather than selling and paying tax.
- **Key Strategy #19:** The tax strategy is to **change your residence every few years.** In the U.S., you can sell your primary residence and exclude up to $500,000 of gain (for a married couple) from tax, provided you've lived in it for two of the last five years. By buying fixer-uppers, improving them, living in them for two years, and then selling, you can generate a series of tax-free gains. This strategy works best for those who enjoy home improvement and don't mind moving.
