Here is a summary of the **Preface, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2** from the provided pamphlet.

### Preface Summary
The preface outlines the historical evolution of Japan's tax system and the role of tax professionals.
- **Historical Context**: Before WWII, the system relied on ex-post remedies. The **Tax Practitioners Law (1942)** created licensed tax practitioners, though primarily to support the tax administration.
- **Post-War Reform**: In 1947, Japan adopted a **self-assessment system**. This was followed by the **Shoup Report (1949)** , an American mission that recommended a shift from indirect to direct taxation (income/corporate tax) and strengthening self-assessment.
- **Modern System**: The recommendations led to the **Certified Public Tax Accountants Law (1951)** , which established Certified Public Tax Accountants as independent, impartial tax professionals to support the self-assessment system.
- **Purpose**: The pamphlet aims to explain Japan's current tax system to non-Japanese readers and introduces the role of Certified Public Tax Accountants. It notes that foreigners may face complexities due to tax treaties and special rules (e.g., transfer pricing) and should consult a Certified Public Tax Accountant in such cases.

### Chapter 1: Organization of Tax Administration Summary
This chapter explains the structure and fundamental principles of Japan's tax administration.
- **Structure of Tax Administration**: Taxation is divided into **National Tax** (administered by the National Tax Agency through regional bureaus and tax offices) and **Local Tax** (administered by prefectural and municipal governments).
- **Key Principles**:
    - **No Taxation Without Law**: Enshrined in the Constitution, taxes can only be imposed or modified by law.
    - **Self-Assessed Taxation System**: Taxpayers calculate their own income, file returns, and pay taxes. This is the standard method for major taxes (income, corporate, consumption). It includes the **Blue Return System** (offering privileges to those keeping proper books) and **e-Filing**.
    - **Assessment Methods**: Besides self-assessment, there is the **official assessment method** (used for property tax) and taxes determined upon establishment (like withholding tax).
- **Tax Inspection and Relief**:
    - If returns have errors or are not filed, tax offices conduct **inspections** and issue **corrections/decisions**.
    - Taxpayers dissatisfied with decisions can file an **administrative protest** with the tax office, request reconsideration with the **National Tax Tribunal**, and ultimately bring the case to **court**.

### Chapter 2: System of Certified Public Tax Accountants Summary
This chapter details the role and organization of Certified Public Tax Accountants in Japan.
- **Role**: Due to the complexity of the tax system, most taxpayers retain Certified Public Tax Accountants. They serve as impartial, independent experts to ensure appropriate tax assessment.
- **Services Provided**:
    - **Monopoly Services**: Acting as an agent in tax filings, tax inspections, and appeals; preparing tax documents; and providing tax consultation.
    - **Supplementary Services**: Preparing financial documents, bookkeeping, and related clerical work.
    - **Assistance in Litigation**.
- **Qualifications**: Certified Public Tax Accountants are licensed professionals who have passed a national exam (or have equivalent qualifications). There are approximately 70,000 registered members. By law, non-registered individuals cannot provide these services.
- **Association**: Certified Public Tax Accountants must register with a regional association. These are organized under the **Japan Federation of Certified Public Tax Accountants Associations**. The **Tokyo Certified Public Tax Accountants' Association** has branches corresponding to tax office areas, providing guidance and study programs for members.
